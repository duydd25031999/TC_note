# Origin

- My **most recent** project is **Bespin**, a **web-based AI platform** designed to help **DevOps engineers** manage **Cloud resources** using **natural language**. You think of it as a **ChatGPT for the Cloud** where users can **control cloud services directly via chat**
- I WAS THE TEAM LEADER. I PARTICIPATE IN THE TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS MANAGING MY TEAM.
- On the **technical side**, my **biggest challenge** was building a **Real-time Web Terminal** to **control EC2 instances** from the **browser**. We needed to **synchronize data streams over unstable connections**, and since **no existing library** met our requirements, I built the logic **from scratch**. This involved **complex tasks** like **detecting command boundaries** and **splitting the output** to feed both the **UI** and the **AI Copilot Assistant**.
- WHEN I TOOK THE **leadership role**, I joined the project **right from the pre-sale phase**. I **analyzed** the client's **raw ideas** to create **high-level designs and WBS for estimation**. I also **coordinated my team** to **adapt** to the **startup’s fast-changing requirements**.
- **Luckily**, the **Web Terminal** became a **core feature**, playing a **key role in securing multiple funding rounds**. The **system** successfully **evolved through 4 phases**, and I was proud to see **our solution directly helping the product BECOME better**.
