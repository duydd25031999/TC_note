# Scrum Event

- `Each event` in Scrum is a `formal` opportunity to `inspect & adapt` `Scrum Artifact`.
	- `Failure` to operate `any events` as prescribed results in `lost` opportunities to `inspect & adapt`.
	- Scrum Events are used to `create regularity` (s·ª± ƒë·ªÅu ƒë·∫∑n) and to `minimize the need for meetings outside Scrum`.
- Scrum events are `designed` to `provoke change`(k√≠ch ƒë·ªông s·ª± thay ƒë·ªïi).

- üí° All events have time-boxed

- Time-boxed = `maximum duration` of event

- Scrum meeting is for `getting feedback` & `taking action` based on
	- Scrum Events are for transparency & inspection
- üí° Scrum Events are mandatory
	- Best hold in same time & space ‚áí reduce complexity.
- If `event ends soon` => doesn't waste time => `force team to other important things`
    - Expect `Sprint` is `fixed timeframe`

## Developer

- `All Developers` are accountable for Product Backlog Items in `Sprint Backlog` and decide how to `best distribute the work`.
	- Developers don‚Äôt distribute work equally

# Sprint
- The Sprint is a `container` for all `other events`.
	- Ideas are turned into value
- Sprints enable `predictability` by ensuring `inspection & adaptation` of progress toward a `Product Goal`

- üí° Scrum Guide doesn‚Äôt have any special Sprints
- `NO`: Release Sprint, Sprint 0, Project Kick-off Sprint, ‚Ä¶.
- Any work must be handled within the Sprint.

- `Only` what has `already happened` may be `used for` forward-looking `decision making`.
	- Various practices exist to `forecast progress`: burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows.
	- While proven `useful`, these do `not replace` the importance of `empiricism`.
	- `Complex` environments ‚áí what will `happen is unknown`
- `Only` the `Product Owner` has the `authority` to `cancel Sprint`.
	- Sprint can only be cancel when Product Owner decide to do that.
	- Product Owner can `cancel Sprint` if`Sprint Goal becomes obsolete` (l·ªói th·ªùi).
	- If part of the `work` is `potentially releasable`, `Product Owner` typically `accepts it`
	- Any `completed` and ‚ÄúDone‚Äù `Product Backlog items` are `reviewed`
	- All `incomplete Product Backlog Items` are `re-estimated` and put `back` on `Product Backlog`

## Sprint Length
- üí° Time-boxed: 1 month
- A `new` Sprint `starts immediately` after the conclusion of the `previous Sprint`.
	- There are no gaps || pauses between sprints.
	- If finish work before Sprint end => Sprint keep going => get more PBI
- Sprint `timeframe` = `fixed`
- Determining the `duration` of the Sprint is a `balancing act`.
- `Shorter Sprint` ‚áí employed to `generate` more `learning cycles` and `limit risk` of `cost & effort` to a smaller timeframe.
	- Each Sprint may be `considered` (xem nh∆∞) a `short project`.
	- Short Sprints to allow for `constantly` (li√™n t·ª•c) `changing requirements`.
	- `Risk is significant in Scrum`, so the shorter the Sprint, the `lower` the `risk` that the development goes in the `wrong direction`.
- Sprint is `too long` ‚áí `Sprint Goal` may become `invalid`, `complexity` may rise, and `risk` may increase.
- `Factors` are `considered` when `establishing` Sprint `length`
	- The `level of uncertainty` over the `technology` to be `used`.
	- The `risk` of being `disconnected` from the `stakeholders`.

## During Sprint

- `No changes` are made that `would endanger the Sprint Goal`
	- Changes still happen ‚áí `Sprint Backlog`
- `Quality` does `not decrease`
- `Product Backlog`  is `refined as needed`
- `Scope` may be `clarified` and `renegotiated` (ƒë∆∞·ª£c ƒë√†m ph√°n l·∫°i) with `Product Owner` as more is learned.

- üí° ‚â• 1 `Product Increment` is created
	- Increment is created but doesn‚Äôt need to be released
	- `NOT require`: at least 1 Product Backlog item refined / work
	- There is no final architecture of the Product in Scrum.

### Scrum Team

- Self-managing

### Developer

- `Develop` at `least one piece of functionality`.
	- `Create` at `least an increment` of potentially releasable software.
- `Track` the `remaining work` of Sprint
	- Create `Product Increment`
	- Manage `Sprint Backlog`
- Collaborate with `Stakeholder` & `Product Owner`
- üí° No necessary to care about developer or skill available for next Sprint
	- Developer team has all the skills needed to develop Product

### Product Owner

- Collaborate with `Stakeholder` & `Developers`
- Manage `Product Backlog`
- `Decide (if || when) release` `Product Increment` with `agreement` of `Developer`

### Scrum Master

- Manage `Scrum implementations`
- Handle `Impediment` (tr·ªü ng·∫°i)

### Stakeholder & Sponsors

- üí° Wait for new released Increment
- The sponsors (nh√† t√†i tr·ª£) of Product can `decide` to `cancel` the `development` effort `after Sprint`.

## Sprint Backlog

- üí° `Sprint Backlog` = `Sprint Goal` + `Top PBIs` + `Plan for delivering`

- The Sprint Backlog is `composed` (bao g·ªìm) of the `Sprint Goal` (`WHY`)
	- The set of `Product Backlog` `items selected` for the Sprint (`WHAT`)
	- An `actionable plan for delivering` `Product Increment`  (`HOW`).
- Sprint Backlog includes:
	- `WHY`: Sprint Goal
	- `WHAT`: Selected PBI
	- `HOW`: Plan
- Sprint Backlog is a plan `by & for` the `Developer`.
	- It is a `highly visible`, `real-time` picture of the work that Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal.
- Sprint Backlog is `created during` `Sprint Planning`
- Sprint Backlog is `updated throughout` `Sprint`.
	- It should have `enough detail` that they can `inspect their progress` in `Daily Scrum`.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è `NOT` commitment || promise

### Sprint Goal

- Sprint Goal is the `single objective` for `Sprint`.
- Sprint Goal is a `commitment` by `Developer`
	- It provides `flexibility in terms` of the exact work `needed to achieve it`.
- The Sprint Goal is `created` during `Sprint Planning`
	- Added to the Sprint Backlog

### Person in Charge

- `Developer` responsible for `Sprint Backlog`
	- `Product Owner` `can't change`
		- `Product Owner` only `collaborate` with `Developer` and suggest.
	- Sprint Backlog selected by `Developer` = selected PBI
- `Developer modify` Sprint Backlog `during` `Sprint`
	- `Add new` work (task) in `if necessary`.
	- `New work` or further decomposition of work `added as soon as possible` after they are identified.
- Developers `keep` the `Sprint Goal` in `mind`
- `Work` turns out to be `different` than Developers `expected`
	- Developers `collaborate` with `Product Owner` to `negotiate` (d√†n x·∫øp) `Sprint scope`.
	- `Without affecting` the Sprint `Goal`.

### Process

1. Define `Sprint Goal`
2. Select `TOP` Product Backlog Item => Sprint Backlog ‚áí achieve `Sprint Goal`
3. Plan `Product Increment`  (release) & Sprint Plan
	- ‚ö†Ô∏è **All** Sprint Backlog Item (SBI) = Product Backlog Item (from Product Backlog)
	- A plan = Decomposition (s·ª± ph√¢n ly) PBI ‚áí small work (task)
	- `Developer` bases on to build `Product Increment`.
4. Incomplete PBIs `move back to Product Backlog`
	- They `may be` estimated and added to `Sprint Backlog of the next Sprint`, so it `doesn't mess up Product Backlog`.
	- Work can `only` be `done` or `not done` right before `Sprint Review`
		- Incomplete work has value as it is `NOT` releasable.
		- `NOT` part of `Product Increment` .
		- `NOT` demonstrated during `Sprint Review`.
		- `NOT`  automatically go to next Sprint.
	- `Product Owner`  will decide them for future sprint.

### Sprint Scope

- Sprint Scope = Scope of Sprint Backlog
	- üí° Amount work in that Sprint
  - `Functionality` developed in that Sprint
- `Developer` & `Product Owner` can `renegotiate` (ƒë√†m ph√°n) Sprint Scope `anytime`
	- ‚ö†Ô∏è `BUT` Sprint Goal can't be changed
	- Ex: Goal = "Have a clean place"
	- Scope = `What want in to done?` & `extend of work`
- `Sprint Backlog` can be `changed` to `fit Sprint Goal` when `changing Scope` of Sprint.
	- Scope of Sprint is `flexible`
	- Scope is `changed` (reduced || extended) based on `reality` and `plan`
		- Reduce not relative work with Sprint Goal
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't plan Sprint Backlog only for Sprint Goal

- Let Sprint Backlog can be flexible during Sprint
- `Don't` let `Sprint Goal` fill `almost Sprint Backlog`
	- It's hard to balance between keeping Sprint Goal and flexible
	- Not always possibly Sprint Backlog focus only Sprint Goal
- Gi·∫£m thi·ªÉu vi·ªác "c·ªë ƒë·∫•m ƒÉn x√¥i" v·ªõi sprint goal

# 1. Sprint Planning
- `Scrum Team` and `Outsider` (Key Stakeholders)
	- The Scrum Team may also `invite other people` to attend Sprint Planning to `provide advice`.
- `Scrum Master` may `help facilitate` the meeting.
	- Provides input into the Sprint Goal
	- Not much involvement.

-----

- Sprint Planning `initiates` the `Sprint`.
    - `Laying out the work to be performed` for the Sprint by the `collaborative` work of the entire `Scrum Team`.
    - `1st` event in Sprint
- Time-boxed = `8h for 1 month sprint`
    - Should reduce if sprint is shorter
- Can refine `Product Backlog`  if there is new insight
- Answer:
    - Why:	Sprint is valuable	        (?) => Sprint Goal
    - What:	Can be done	                (?) => `Sprint Backlog`
    - How:	Chosen work is done					(?) => Plan

- üí° `Sprint Backlog` = `Sprint Goal` + `Top PBIs` + `Plan for delivering`

- The input to the Sprint Planning is:
	1. `Product Backlog`
	2. The `latest` product `Increment`
	3. Projected `capacity of the Development Team` during the Sprint
	4. `Past performance` of Development Team
- **Th·ªùi l∆∞·ª£ng**¬†: th∆∞·ªùng trong kho·∫£ng 1h ƒë·ªëi v·ªõi kick off sprint trong 1 tu·∫ßn

## 1.0. Scrum Team - `Who` attends in Sprint Planning?

- üí° Entire Scrum team join into Sprint Planning

- `Scrum Team` `collaborates` to define a `Sprint Goal` that communicates `why` the Sprint is `valuable` to `Stakeholders`.
    - Scrum Team may also invite `other people` to attend Sprint Planning to `provide advice`.
- `Scrum Team` may `refine PBIs` during this process

### Product Owner

- Product Owner `proposes` (ƒë·ªÅ xu·∫•t) `how` the product could `increase its value & utility` in the current Sprint.
- The Product Owner `ensures` attendees `discuss` the `most important` Product Backlog items
	- How they map to the Product Goal.
	- Clarify PBIs
- Answer `Developer` question
	- Advise to Developer team

### Developer

- `Developer` `pull work by self`
- The Developers `collaborate` with `Product Owner` until the end of meeting.
	- They need to `discuss` if `Sprint Goal` is still `reachable` and try to `adapt Sprint scope`.
	- If Developers find any problem during Sprint Planning, Sprint Goal still be modified if necessary
- üí° All `Developer` are responsible for outcome
	- How this is `done` is at the `sole discretion` (quy·∫øt ƒë·ªãnh ri√™ng) of the `Developer`.
	- `No one` else tells them `how` to turn `Product Backlog` items into `Product Increment`  of value.
	- `Developer` s plan the work necessary to meets the `Definition of Done` .

### Scrum Master

- üí°Host meeting
- Clear `Scrum Artifact`
- Explain purpose
- Keep event in time-box

### Stakeholder

- Help `Product Owner` answer
- Join unless invited

## 1.1. Sprint Goal - `Why` sprint is valuable?

- üí° Each sprint should create value thing.

- Whole `Scrum Team` `collaborates` to define a `Sprint Goal` that communicates `why` the Sprint is `valuable` to `Stakeholders`.
    - Product Owner `proposes` (ƒë·ªÅ xu·∫•t) `how` the product could `increase its value & utility` in the current Sprint.
- Sprint Goal = specific, measurable, flexibility
    - `Specific` & `Measurable` = Measurable result = ‚Ä£
    - `Flexibility` ‚áí Not fixed how
- `Sprint Goal` must be `finalized prior` (ho√†n thi·ªán tr∆∞·ªõc) to the `end of Sprint Planning`.
    - During Sprint Planning meeting, it is possible to modify the Sprint Goal

## 1.2. Sprint Backlog - `What` can be Done this Sprint?

- `Developer` `selects` items from the `Product Backlog`  to include in the current Sprint.
    - Through `discussion`, `collaboration` with the `Product Owner`.
    - `Sprint Backlog` get `top PBIs`.
    - `Forecast` PBIs selected by `Developer` can be finished in this sprint.
- `Scrum Team` may `refine PBIs` during this process
    - Increases `understanding` and `confidence`.
- Selecting `how much` can be completed within a Sprint may be `challenging` with aspects:
    - `Past performance`: velocity - empirical data
    - `Upcomming capacity for the Sprint`: man-hours in sprint
    - `Definition of Done`: Quality of team
    
    ‚áí Based on `Confident in Sprint forecasts`.
- üí° `Developer` pull work by self
	- `NOT` pushed || assigned

## 1.3. Plan - `How` will the chosen work be done?

- Each selected `Product Backlog` item, `Developer` plan to create `Product Increment` that meets the `Definition of Done`
    - `Decompose` (ph√¢n ly) Product Backlog items into smaller work items - tasks of `one day or less`.
        - Estimate for each task
        - Review (re-select) Sprint Backlog items
        - Plan for Sprint
- `Sprint Planning` has `outcome` ‚áí `Sprint Backlog`

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sprint Backlog = never completed
	- Plan detailed enough to handle

# 2. Daily Scrum
- Developer - Only
- Get `feedback`
- `Scrum Master` ensures `Developer` have the `meeting by themselves`.
		- `Scrum Master` does `not participate`
		- `Scrum Master` may `observe` in order to later `provide feedback` to the `Development Team` on how to possibly `improve the event`.

-----

- üí° Daily Scrum ch·ªâ ƒë·ªÉ th√¥ng b√°o, kh√¥ng ƒë·ªÉ ra quy·∫øt ƒë·ªãnh, kh√¥ng n√™n k√©o d√†i qu√° th·ªùi gian

- **Daily stand-up**
- **Stand-up**
- **Daily**
</aside>

- `Inspect` progress `toward` the `Sprint Goal` and `adapt` the `Sprint Backlog` as necessary
	- `Informal`
	- `Same time & place` every working day ‚áí `reduce complexity`
	- Key: ‚Äúinspect & adapt‚Äù

- üí° Time-box: 15 minutes
	- Any more information ‚áí let after || outside Daily Scrum
	- Scrum Guide does `NOT REQUIRE` Scrum Board

## During
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This event is mandatory

- This event is `only` for `Developer`
	- Adjust `Developer` plan
	- More `detailed discussions` about `adapting or re-planning` the rest of the `Sprint`‚Äôs work.
	- If `Product Owner` or `Scrum Master`  are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.
- The Developers can select `whatever structure and techniques they want`
	- Daily Scrum focuses on progress `toward` the `Sprint Goal` and `produces` an `actionable plan` for the `next day` of work.
	- Developer has to choice format of Daily Scrum
	- Not needed for report progress `Scrum Master` & `Product Owner`
- Each member can answer 3 questions:
	- What I did yesterday?
	- What I plan to do today?
	- Do I have any blockers?

- üí° Daily Scrum `creates focus` and `improves self-management` to`Developer`
	- Improve communications
	- Identify impediments
	- Guide decision-making
	- Consequently eliminate (lo·∫°i b·ªè) the need for other meetings.

- `Scrum Master``ensures `Developer` have the `meeting by themselves`.
	- `Scrum Master` guide & make sure it happen
	- If others are `present` at the Daily Scrum, ensures that they do `not disrupt the meeting`
	- Scrum Master doesn‚Äôt do anything else.
- People collaborate = inspect ‚áí `Scrum Artifact`

## Scrum Board

- Manage work of `Developer`
    - All Developers remain accountable
    - Decide who do what
- Board to check status of features in Sprint Backlog
- A Scrum board is typically structured in the form of columns
- The goal of the sprint is to basically move all the tickets from the leftmost column to the right.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not mandatory in Scum

# 3. Sprint Review
- `Scrum Team` and `key Stakeholder`
- Get `feedback`
- `Scrum Master` may `help facilitate` the meeting.
- Time-boxed: `4 hours for a monthly Sprint`

----

- The purpose of the Sprint Review is to `inspect` the `outcome` of the Sprint and `determine future adaptations`.
  - All `Scrum Team` (Scaling Scrum) & `Stakeholder` inspect outcome
	- üí° ‚Äúinspect & adapt‚Äù meeting
    
- `Scrum Team` `presents the results` of their work to `key Stakeholders`.
    - `Progress toward the Product Goal` is discussed.
    - They will also `discuss` what has `changed` in the `environment` and `adapt` the `Product Backlog` as needed.
    - If the `Product Backlog` does `not` contain the `newest insights`, it is `outdated`
- During the event, `Scrum Team` and `Stakeholders` review what was `accomplished` in the `Sprint`and what has `changed` in their `environment`.
    - Attend by `Key & Relevant` stakeholder
- Show `outcome`: `Product Increment` & `Sprint Goal` & Other results
    - The Sprint Review is an opportunity for `Scrum Team` to `inspect Increment` with the `Stakeholders` and `get feedback`.
    - `Stakeholders` will `give Feedback`
- `Meeting result` = Revise (c·∫£i ti·∫øn) `Product Backlog`
    - `Unfinish` work is put back to `Product Backlog`
- `Product Owner` decide `what to do next`
    - `Scrum Team` and `Stakeholders`  collaborate on `what to do next`.
- üí° Time-boxed: `4 hours for a monthly Sprint`.
	- `Scrum Team` should avoid limiting it to a presentation.

- Sprint review = bu·ªïi demo th√†nh qu·∫£.
	- Kh√¥ng h·∫≥n c·ªßa ri√™ng Scrum Team m√† c√≥ c·∫£ Stakeholder.
	- V·∫´n c√≥ th·ªÉ t·ªï ch·ª©c m√† kh√¥ng c√≥ Stakeholder

## Skip

### Scrum Team skip many Sprint Review

- `Product Backlog` might get `outdated`.
- `Stakeholder feedback` will be `obtained` (thu ƒë∆∞·ª£c) with `delay` (ch·∫≠m tr·ªÖ).
- Opportunities to `inspect & adapt` are `reduced`.
- `Increases` the possibility of working on `features nobody needs`.

### Stakeholders skip many Sprint Review

- `Disconnect` with `Developer` work
- Don‚Äôt meet their expectations

## Environment

- Anything impacts Product
	- Market place
	- Customer demand
	- New opportunity

## Flow

1. `Scrum Team` & `Stakeholders` `review` what was `accomplished` in the Sprint
2. `Product Owner` decide `what to do next`
	- `Scrum Team` and `Stakeholders`  collaborate on `what to do next`.
- üí° The development process is inspected during the Sprint Retrospective.

- `Scrum Team` & `Stakeholder` can `communicate anytime` in Sprint
- `Developers` is `self-managing`
	- Product Owner & Stakeholder `can‚Äôt verify development work`

# 4. Sprint Retrospective
- Scrum Team - Only
- `Scrum Master` is an event participant at the `same level` as `Product Owner` and `Developer` members.

----

- Sprint Retrospective is to `plan` ways to `increase` `quality` and `effectiveness`.
- `Scrum Team` inspects `how the last Sprint went` with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their `Definition of Done` .
	- Bu·ªïi ri√™ng c·ªßa Scrum Team ‚áí b√†n lu·∫≠n v·ªÅ c√°ch c·∫£i thi·ªán ch·∫•t l∆∞·ª£ng l√†m vi·ªác
	- `Inspected elements` often `vary` (thay ƒë·ªïi) with the `domain of work`.
	- Identify `assumptions` (gi·∫£ ƒë·ªãnh) led `Scrum Team` `astray` (l·∫°c l·ªëi)
- `Scrum Team` discusses what during the Sprint
	- What `went well`
	- What `problems` it `encountered`
	- `How` those problems were (or were not) `solved`.
	- Identifies the `most helpful changes` to improve its `effectiveness` 
	- The `most impactful improvements` are addressed `as soon as possible.`
- It is at the end of each Sprint.
	- Improvement plan can be added ‚áí `Product Backlog` & `Sprint Backlog` in `next` `Sprint`

- üí° Time-box: `3 hours for 1 month Sprint

- Time to change `Definition of Done`
	- No need to `Definition of Done` change every `Sprint`

## During

- Sprint Retrospective is for entire `Scrum Team`
	- Define what `keep going`
	- Define what `need to be fixed`
	- `Plan` to improve
- `Scrum Master` is an event participant at the `same level` as `Product Owner` and `Developer` members.
	- `Scrum Master` `may` be `Facilitator` of this meeting
	- Make sure everyone understand value
		- Use Post-It note
- `Product Owner` attend as member
- This event is internal to the Scrum Team ‚Äì `nobody else is invited` or attends.
- Scrum Team identifies several `high priority process improvements`.
	- Scrum Team may `add items` to `Sprint Backlog` for the next `Sprint`.

## Flow

1. Warm-up excercise: [FunRetrospectives | Have fun, learn from the past and prepare for the future!](https://www.funretrospectives.com/)
    
2. Gathering data about `Sprint`
	- Set time-box to think & write ideas
	- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use balloon image
3. Just discuss important things
	- Votes the priority ‚áí sort (order) the topics
	- Outcome:
		- Which needs to improvement
		- Steps to do that
