- The **interface is similar** to typical AI Chatbots **like ChatGPT**.
- Users can select the instance ID and region to focus the conversation on a specific cloud service, making it easier to manage.
- The response of AI chatbot also has **many type: text, code, graph, workplan form, etc;** based on user's question

### Agent

- `Agent` refers to a **component in an AI system or cloud management assistant**
- The `Agent` can be a background service or AI worker responsible for:
    - **Receiving user prompts**
    - Analyzing the intent, **calling the corresponding API** (e.g., AWS CLI, Copilot CLI)
    - Executing tasks such as **creating services, deploying applications, or monitoring**
    - Sending results back to the chatbot or user interface

### AI Model

- Select the type of AI model to perform question answering
    - ChatGPT 30
    - KKANA3 70B
    - Claude 3.5 Sonnet#

## Freshdesk

- Engineer user can manage **Freshdesk to support customer**
    - Categorize, track, respond to, and resolve tickets
    - Provide a self-service portal for customers
- Engineer user view the details of the ticket and add notes to the ticket.

## AWS Copilot

- **AWS Copilot** is an official **CLI tool** provided by AWS to help developers easily **deploy and manage containerized applications** on services like:
    - Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
    - AWS Fargate
    - App Runner
- With Bespin, interaction with AWS is more easier with Chatbox interface

### AWS Conductor agent

- AWS Conductor is a custom AI-powered agent developed as part of the Bespin platform.
- It acts as a layer that allows users to **control AWS Copilot via natural language or structured forms**. 

### Workplan

- A Workplan is a **structured, deployment plan** that defines what cloud infrastructure to create **configure it, and execute it using AWS Copilot**, all coordinated by AWS Conductor.
    - Users must select `aws_conductor` agent for room chat
- User manages AWS Workplans
    - Access pre-defined **AWS Workplan templates**
    - Generate custom Workplans using natural language prompts
    - System suggests the most relevant template based on intent
- **Execute the Workplan** and view its detailed execution steps
    - AI analyzes execution results and provides actionable suggestions
    - View real-time status of each execution step
- **Save personalized Workplan templates** for future use
- Workplans are editable and support variable-based form generation

## EKS Copilot

- EKS Copilot is a **chat-based AI assistant** that helps developers **interact with Amazon EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service) using natural language or form-based inputs - **suggest `kubectl` commands or `Helm` charts**.
-  Users **manage their EKS clusters**, so that they can efficiently deploy, monitor, and troubleshoot applications in Kubernetes without diving deep into command-line tools or extensive documentation.

## Mermaid

- **Generate diagram from nature language prompt** directly without going over code
- When AI chat generate the code representing diagram, the system would use Mermaind library to apply the diagram overriding the code

## Web terminal

### Introduction

- **Elastic Compute Cloud** (EC2): a **renting virtual computers (instances) service**, launch virtual servers 
- **AWS Systems Manager** (SSM): a comprehensive management service **manages and configures AWS resources** (EC2 instances, on-premises servers, and virtual machines)
- User control EC2 remotely with the help of OS copilot
- Effortlessly manage EC2 instances via a web terminal with intelligent OS Copilot assistance. 
- This feature simplifies remote control, offering context-aware help, suggested commands, integrated file editing

### Activity Flow

1. List EC2 on main chatbot
    1. BE attaches EC2 instance id in AI response with specific format: i-{instance_id}
    2. FE catch EC2 instance id by regex then transform them into a button to open web terminal
2. Open Terminal Popup
    - Web terminal has 2 part
    1. Left: Terminal UI: User run the command on web terminal to remote EC2
    2. Right: Copilot: GPT AI chatbot supports user to control EC2
3. Use Web terminal to remote EC2
    - Web terminal connects directly to AWS EC2 with SSM
    - Every keydown event is sent directly to AWS EC2
    - File Editor: when running a editing file command, open a specific web editor to modify file with support from OS Copilot
4. Use Copilot to suggest command to control EC2
    - System administrator attaches context so that chat OS can read the attached documents to answer questions related to the desired content
    - Suggest command for user to remote. With confirmation, it can be executed without copy into web terminal
5. Edit file with Copilot support
    1. Catch editing file command on Web terminal
    2. Open specific file editor on left side
    3. Edit file on editor
    4. Use Copilot for modification suggest, show copilot response on right side and comparative between original and insert content of left side
    5. Save file
6. Show activity logs
    - Show activity logs history
    - View activity log
    - Download log file
