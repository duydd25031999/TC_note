## Project Introduction

### Project Overview

- Project `Bespin` is a web‑based chatbot platform that lets cloud‑focused engineers manage servers and AWS resources through natural‑language conversations.
- Users can query multiple AI models (ChatGPT, Copilot, bespoke LLMs) or escalate to in‑house experts, then execute the resulting commands in a secure, real‑time web terminal.
- Over four phases the product has expanded from basic Q&A to full remote control, attracting investor interest and demonstrating the power of combining AI guidance with human expertise.
- Web chatbot for server and cloud management.
- Dual‑layer answers: AI first, human experts refine.

## Goals

1. `Multi‑Model Q&A` - Support ChatGPT, Copilot, etc., for coding, server, and AWS questions.
2. `Natural‑Language Control` - Convert user queries to shell/CLI commands and execute safely.
3. `AI‑Driven System Design` - Generate architecture diagrams and design documents.
4. `Human Expert Support` - Provide live specialists to augment AI responses.
