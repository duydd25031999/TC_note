Brief Description
- This project is designed to help me practice and refine my spoken responses to my software developing experience interview questions includes Team leader, Quality, Effort management, ... in preparation for English-only Senior-level job interviews. I am a Senior Front-end Developer with leadership and presale experience, and I estimate my current English speaking proficiency to be at IELTS Speaking 5.5. In this project, I will attach a series of Markdown files—each covering a different topic in Software developing experience, including both theory and practice questions. ChatGPT will assist me in expressing my answers clearly, accurately, and confidently in English. The project’s focus is not just correctness, but also clarity, fluency, and suitability for a real interview setting.

- To develop confidence in delivering technical answers clearly in a 100% English interview environment.

Problem Statement
- While I have strong technical knowledge and leadership experience in ReactJS development, I find it challenging to express this knowledge fluently and clearly in English under interview pressure. Given that my speaking level is approximately IELTS 5.5, I often struggle with expressing complex thoughts in a structured and concise way during high-stakes conversations. I need a way to systematically improve my delivery, especially for technical questions, by refining my spoken responses and getting English-language feedback that’s aligned with both my content and my communication style. Traditional learning tools don’t offer real-time, personalized coaching with my existing knowledge files—which is the gap this project will fill. I also want to study deeper into software presale process so that I can interview into job requires software sale position and customer communication.
