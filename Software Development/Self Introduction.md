# Introduce Yourself

**Q:** Can you introduce yourself and your work experience

- My name is Duy.
- I have three years experience for web development.
- I have worked for three companies.
    1. The first is FPT Software, I have joined in a project for translation. I have worked as a Frontend Developer with VueJS Framework.
    2. The second company is IMPL, this is a outsourcing company for Japanese customer. I also applied as a a Frontend Developer.
        - But this company had a lot of PHP projects, but PHP teams didn’t have enough members to resolve all tasks.
        - So I was moved to PHP team and worked with both roles Frontend and Backend.
    3. The last company is Seal Commerce, this is a Vietnamese product company.
- Do you know Shopify platform ?
- This company is a partner of Shopify. We develop a web builder app for Shopify.
- I applied as Frontend Developer and the product, first is built on jQuery, after several years, it move to. VueJS, but the core features still code in jQuery.

## Options

- Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be interviewed for this position today.
- This project doesn’t a product owner, so I and development team had to join to develop the feature specification.
- I work directly with the designer to design the functionality together.
- I also help the customer service team to support customer. If there was urgent bug, I had to fix it immediately.
- When working in last company, I had two times being monthly spotlight in Development team.
- I have learned a number of other frameworks as well as other technologies but have not participated in any real projects so I am most confident in Vuejs.
- Now I am looking for a Frontend Development job with VueJS.

# Impressive project / recent project

**Q:** What is the most impressive project you have worked on?

- The last project I have worked on may the most impressive project me until now.
- In fact, it doesn't have many big features that need a lot of technology.
- But I had to take on many responsibilities in that project and learned a lot of thing about developing a own product.
- The first time was an opportunity for me to contact directly to the end user.
    - Because a lot of our users are not very technical, they are just sales people, doing advertising, so I often work with the customer service team to support them when they have problems. Can help them build better interfaces, help them create animations, tracing bugs on their device.
- The second is to participate in the requirements specification of a new feature.
    - The company doesn't really have a product owner, so when the leadership comes up with an idea for a new function, the development team and the design team will have to jointly develop the requirement for that feature.
- Next is working with a testers team.
    - When working at 2 previous companies, the project has only 1 tester or the dev team will not work directly with the tester. But in this last company, I work directly with a testers team.
    - Each frontend developer will take care of 1 feature at a time, but there are many testers testing the features. In general, they put a lot of pressure on me when developing a feature, or even fixing a user bug.
- The last is working with product ecosystem, UI Kit.  **(optional)**
    - The company has many products, many repositories. But the design team uses the same design language, a UI Kit for the entire product. If they change even one small point in that UI Kit, it will affect a lot of products.

- Dự án mà em ấn tượng nhất là dự án hiện tại mà em đang làm.
- Đây là dự án làm việc cho khách hàng Hàn Quốc
- Ứng dụng này phục vụ cho việc quản lý dịch thuật cho các tài liệu về sản phẩm như hướng dẫn sử dụng, yêu cầu sản phẩm, test case, vân vân
- Chúng em đảm nhiệm maintain và thêm tính năng mới cho dự án
- Trong dự án thì em làm cả phần backend và frontend
- Nhưng vì có nhiều kinh nghiệm về Front-end nên em làm thêm về các tasks Front-end nhiều
- Đặc biệt của là dự án làm với công nghệ mới NodeJS là Strapi
- Cái này rất hỗ trợ cho những người thế mạnh về Front-end như em có thể làm back-end dễ dàng hơn
- Vì nó có sẵn các base về controller, model rồi
- Cấu trúc thì gọn và dễ hiểu
