Brief Description
- This project aims to help me prepare for software engineering interviews by building confident, fluent, and structured answers for self-introduction and project descriptions in English. It also acts as a personal assistant for understanding and practicing key knowledge in the presale phase — such as effort estimation, stakeholder communication, and requirement clarification.

Key Objectives
- Support writing and improving answers for introduction at the beginning of interview meeting and presale knowledge
- Generate 9+ scoring sample answers for reference.
- Provide feedback and scoring based on key criteria (realism, uniqueness, engagement, etc.).
- Help me understand and practice presale knowledge used in real-world client-facing roles.

Problem Statement
- I struggle with:
  - Expressing their background clearly in interviews, especially in English.
  - Making their experience stand out with confidence and structure.
  - Understanding and applying presale knowledge when asked during technical or advisory discussions.
  - Practicing under pressure in realistic interview conditions.
- This project helps address these issues through guided writing, evaluation, and repetition — tailored to my actual experience and target roles.
