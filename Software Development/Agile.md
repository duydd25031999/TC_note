# Agile

### Questions

[1. {Interrogate} How does the concept of "emergence" in Agile challenge traditional project planning methods?](./Scrum_Questions.md#agile-concept-1)

[2. {Interrogate} How does Agile ensure product quality and flexibility without relying on detailed documentation?](./Scrum_Questions.md#agile-concept-2)

## Concept

- Agile is a software development methodology
- Iterative approach to development
- Builds software incrementally from the start of the project
    - Instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.
- Release each version of product
- Allows easy changing in the development process

- Keeping the overall development flexible and adaptive.
    - Keep requirements and documentation lightweight and flexible.
- The most of these things, most of the time are difficult to estimate or predict.
- The best way to get them done would be to keep the highest priority tickets at the top of the blacklog
- Development team work on them one by one and get them to a done state

- Agile is a time boxed
- Iterative approach (framework) to software delivery

- Scrum : Use for projects with defined features
- Kanban: Use for support, unpredictable development

- An Agile¬†iteration is a short one to two week period where a team takes most important user stories, builds them completely and deliver as running-tested-software to the customer.
    - Analysis, design, coding, testing happen during an iteration.

# Kanban

### Questions

[1. {Scan} How does limiting Work In Progress (WIP) in Kanban improve both the quality and speed of delivery?](./Scrum_Questions.md#kanban-waterfall-1)

## Concept

- Visualizing work
- Limitig work in progress
- Simple to implement
    - Not define new meetings or roles
    - No sprints or iterations
- Origins in manufactoring => Kanban Method Guide
- Can combine Scrum & Kanban
- Common workflow for service

## Progress

- At least 3 columns: To-Do, Work in Progress (WIP), DONE
- Kanban item = Kanban card
    - Hold the equivalent content of a user story
- To-Do column: Backlog
- WIP column:
    - Kanban teams can also set a limit on the number of work items in each column of the board.
        - Limit showing the team's working capacity in a certain time
        - Limits th·ªÉ hi·ªán nƒÉng l·ª±c l√†m vi·ªác c·ªßa team trong 1 th·ªùi gian nh·∫•t ƒë·ªãnh
- Done column:
    - Move from WIP column
- Create continue flow of WORK & VALUE
    - Lead time: time from added idea to Backlog to release
    - Cycle time: how long the development work took
        - From To-Do to Done
    - üí° Kanban `doesn‚Äôt` involve `sprints`
    - The main goal is to have a `smooth flow` of work from start to completion `without` any stoppage or bottlenecks.
- The team must define what that flow of work details.
    - How does a particular work item go from start to completion?
    - What are the various steps or stages that it would go through?
    - What is involved with transitioning the work items through each stage and ultimately getting it to a done state?

# Scrum

## Definition

[1. {Scan} Why is Scrum considered a "lightweight framework" rather than a full methodology?](./Scrum_Questions.md#scrum-concept-1)

üí° Scrum is a lightweight `framework` that helps people, teams and organizations generate `value` through adaptive solutions for `complex problems`.

- Scrum is `rules`
- Scrum can be `used anywhere` (not only software development) {Q3}

- **Scrum** is one of the most popular `framework`s for implementing¬†`*Agile`.*
    - Scrum is probably the most highly recognized agile methodology.
- Scrum is adopt for its `product development` to `deliver more value` to its `Users` and `Stakeholders`
    - Try it as is and determine if its `philosophy`(tri·∫øt l√Ω), `theory`, and `structure` help to achieve goals and create value.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è The Scrum framework consists of¬†**Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules**.

- `Each component` within the Scrum framework `serves a specific purpose` and is `essential` (b·∫£n ch·∫•t) to `Scrum‚Äôs success and usage`.

## Process

[2. {Scan} How does Scrum use iterative and incremental delivery to manage risk?](./Scrum_Questions.md#scrum-concept-2)

1. A Product Owner `orders the work` for a `complex problem` into a Product Backlog.
2. The Scrum Team turns a `selection of the work` into a Product Increment of value during a Sprint.
3. The Scrum Team and its `Stakeholder`s `inspect` the `results` and `adjust` for the `next Sprint`.
4. Repeat

## Management (s·ª± qu·∫£n l√Ω)

[3. {Interrogate} What is the role of management in an organization adopting Scrum, and why is it still necessary?](./Scrum_Questions.md#scrum-concept-3)

- The `Management` is expected to `set` a `vision` and a `direction` for the `business`.
    - S·ª± qu·∫£n l√Ω t·ª´ Organization
- It `supports` the Product Owner with `business insights` and helps the Scrum Master in causing `change` within the `organization`.
- While the `Scrum Guide` says `nothing` about `Management`, it does not mean that the `organization` will no longer `have managers`.
- They still play an `important role` but need to `understand empiricism`, Scrum, and allow the teams to self-manage.

## Characteristic

### Purposefully Incomplete

[4. {Scan} Why is Scrum intentionally incomplete, and how does this benefit organizations using it?](./Scrum_Questions.md#scrum-concept-4)

- Scrum framework is `Purposefully Incomplete`.
    - üí° `Only` defining the `parts` required to `implement Scrum theory`.
    - `Rather` than provide people with `detailed instructions`, the rules of Scrum `guide` their `relationships` and `interactions`.
    - Scrum c·ªë √Ω kh√¥ng ho√†n thi·ªán, ch·ªâ ƒë·∫£m b·∫£o c√°c rules extend t·ª´ Scrum theory ƒë·ªÉ h∆∞·ªõng d·∫´n m·ªói quan h·ªá v√† s·ª± t∆∞∆°ng t√°c trong Scrum team
- Scrum is `built` upon by the `Collective Intelligence` of the people using it.
    - Scrum d·ª±a tr√™n mindset c·ªßa nh·ªØng ng∆∞·ªùi tham gia

### Various (ƒëa d·∫°ng) Processes

[5. {Scan} How can different practices and methods be integrated within Scrum without violating its principles?](./Scrum_Questions.md#scrum-concept-5)

- `Various` processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the framework.
    - Scrum `wraps` around `existing practices`.
    - `Renders` them `unnecessary`.
    - Scrum cho ph√©p s·ª≠ d·ª•ng c√°ch kƒ© thu·∫≠t ƒëa d·∫°ng khi ph√°t tri·ªÉn & th·ª±c hi·ªán ch√∫ng theo c√°ch kh√¥ng b·∫Øt bu·ªôc

### Documentation

[6. {Scan} Why doesn‚Äôt the Scrum Guide mandate specific documentation practices, and how should teams handle documentation needs?](./Scrum_Questions.md#scrum-concept-6)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Scrum Guide doesn't require documentation.
- Documentation is useful to develop product

### Relative Efficacy (Hi·ªáu qu·∫£ t∆∞∆°ng ƒë·ªëi)

[7. {Scan} How does Scrum expose the relative efficacy of current management and work practices?](./Scrum_Questions.md#scrum-concept-7)

- Scrum makes `visible` the `Relative Efficacy`:
    - `Current` Management
    - `Current` Environment
    - `Current` Work techniques

‚áí Improvements can be made.

### Cone of Uncertainty

[8. {Scan} What is the Cone of Uncertainty in Scrum, and how should teams manage it during development?](./Scrum_Questions.md#scrum-concept-8)

‚ö†Ô∏è `LONGER` the Forecast => `HIGHER` the Uncertainty
    - Never COMMITMENT
- Describe the Uncertainty by Cone
- Like Forecast the Hurricane

# Waterfall
