# **Introduction**

## **Information**

This internship training program is designed to provide aspiring developers with a comprehensive foundation in web development. It serves as a structured learning path where interns engage in both theoretical learning and practical project work. Over the course of the program, participants will work through fundamental concepts in programming and modern development practices while simultaneously applying this knowledge to build a real web application. The aim is to simulate a full-stack development experience at a junior level, giving interns a well-rounded overview of the technologies and processes involved in creating a web application.

## **Background**

The program was initiated to address a common gap in specialization-focused training. Many interns enter the field aiming to become back-end developers or DevOps engineers, yet they often lack exposure to the full spectrum of web development. By ensuring interns learn the basics of front-end, back-end, and even some DevOps concepts, this internship lays down a general knowledge base. With a solid understanding of how each layer of web development works together, interns will be better prepared for any niche they choose later on. Whether they eventually specialize as a front-end developer, back-end developer, or DevOps specialist, they will carry forward a stronger, more holistic skill set.

## **Vision**

The vision of this internship training is to produce capable, self-sufficient junior developers who can confidently contribute to real projects. Rather than sitting in a classroom absorbing theory, interns in this program learn primarily by doing – they will collaborate on building a complete project from scratch. This project-based approach, coupled with guided self-study, encourages critical thinking and problem-solving. Through the process, interns also learn professional responsibility: they are expected to take ownership of tasks, meet deadlines, and adapt to feedback, mirroring the accountability found in a real work environment. By the end of the training, the goal is for each intern to have not only improved their technical skills but also developed the mindset and habits of a proactive, responsible developer.

## **Scope & Limitations**

This internship program focuses on the completion of a single real-world web development project at a junior developer level. Interns will function as full-stack developers for this project, tackling tasks from implementing user interfaces to setting up basic server-side logic and interacting with a database. The training combines hands-on work on project tasks with a comprehensive checklist of topics for self-study, ensuring coverage of fundamental concepts. However, the scope is deliberately limited to foundational skills and the requirements of the chosen project. It will not delve into every advanced or specialized topic in web development or DevOps. The intent is to provide breadth and practical experience — a solid launching pad — while recognizing that true mastery in any specific area will require further learning and experience beyond this program.
