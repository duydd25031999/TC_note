# Extreme Programming (XP)

- Framework for developing software with agility
- Follow Agile values and principles
- High level quaity programming
- Can collaborate with Scrum

## Pair Programming

- 2 programmers share the keyboard
    1. Driver: code writing
    2. Navigator: leading the work

## Unit testing code

- No code is written without adding the associated tests
- Better understanding code = describe it with test case

## Code review

- Every code need to review before intergrating into Product

## Spike Solutions

- Deal with hard technical problem
1. Run small experiments
    - Isolation from main development effort
2. Test the theory
    - Mostly code doesn't have production quaity as expecting
    - Keep learning
    - Estimate requirement better

## You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI)

- Avoid adding functionality early on
- Lean thinking & guiding principle
- ⚠️ We should implement something only when we actually need it
- Never in anticipation

# Test-driven development (TDD)

- Agile Software development practice.
- Business requirements = tranfer => test case before programming.
    - Understand interface of the code before doing it
    - Easy to refactor
- Changing requirements or Fixing bugs => FIRST changing tests => adapting the code
- Require higher quality of code.

## Behavior-driven development (BDD)

- Agile Software development practice.
- Have conversations about Business requirement before programming.
- BDD use natural language constructs
    - Create sentences => describe Business requirement in term of Behavior & Expect outcome
    - Behavior ≈ manual test case
    - Share understanding between Business Analyst and Developer

# DevOps

- Developer:
    - Build software
    - Add new feature
    - Know little: infrastructure of software
- SysAdmin:
    - Build & maintain the IT infrastructure
    - Know little: operating of software
- DevOps:
    - DevOps is set of practices => build successful product.
    - Automating Tasks: building & deploying software => CI/CD
    - Move with Agile
