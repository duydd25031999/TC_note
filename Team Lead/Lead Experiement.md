## Adaptability
- Definition: Embracing the uniqueness of every project and being ready to adjust quickly to unforeseen challenges.
- Actions:
	- Start with a brainstorming session to capture a wide range of ideas.
	- Set a time limit to encourage focused yet rapid ideation.
- Example: When a customer requested a new feature, I convened a time-limited brainstorming meeting, allowing all ideas—even those not immediately feasible—to be shared, demonstrating our readiness to pivot and adjust.

## Order (Discipline)
- Definition: Establishing clear processes and structured workflows to maintain clarity and organization while still allowing creativity.
- Actions:
	- Organize meetings in distinct phases (brainstorm, evaluation, backlog creation).
	- Create a dedicated Confluence page for Q&A and documentation of decisions.
	- Develop flexible guidelines that maintain structure without stifling creativity.
- Example: I required the team to document every decision on Confluence, ensuring that all guidelines and Q&A were recorded. This practice maintained a structured environment and served as a reference when conflicts arose.

## Responsibility
- Definition: A commitment where each team member understands their individual role and appreciates that the entire team’s success depends on every person’s contributions.
- Actions:
	- Clearly communicate individual as well as team responsibilities from the start.
	- Stress that one person’s issues impact the whole team, promoting collective accountability.
- Example: I emphasized the concept that if one team member encountered a problem, it would affect the overall outcome, reinforcing the idea that everyone must take ownership of their tasks.

## Smart Work Organization
- Definition: Efficiently managing tasks by balancing quality with productivity, ensuring that work is prioritized to match both business needs and team capabilities.
- Actions:
	- Categorize tasks based on three criteria: importance (value to the product), urgency (impact on workflow), and ease (developer assessment).
	- Arrange the project backlog accordingly to streamline task assignment and execution.
- Example: I organized the project’s tasks into a backlog by categorizing them as important, urgent, and easy, which allowed for a more strategic and manageable distribution of work among team members.

### Clear Role Definition:

- When communicating with other departments or customers, clearly outline and confirm the responsibilities of each party so that we all move toward the product’s common goals.

### Assumption Management:

- If any issues arise where I am unsure about the details before a handover, I proactively document my assumptions and later confirm them with the relevant parties.

### Dedicated Information Channels:

- Create separate Q&A pages for each major development phase (each version) and for interactions with different stakeholder groups. This ensures the team’s activities are visible and traceable.

### Encouraged Transparency:

- Promote communication with external parties—through documented comments and shared pages—to maintain a clear record of updates and decisions for future reference.

## Mentorship
