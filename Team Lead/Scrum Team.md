# Scrum Team

- The `fundamental unit` of Scrum is `Scrum Team`
- Scrum Team = `1` `Scrum Master` + `1` `Product Owner` + `N` `Developer`
	- There are `accountabilities`
		- `NOT` Job || Role
	- Responsible for `decisions` or `actions`.
	- The `results` of the `entire Scrum Team` depend on the `time` `Scrum Master` & `Product Owner` `dedicate`.
- Scrum Team is expected to `adapt` the moment it `learns anything new` through `inspection`.
	- It is a `cohesive` (g·∫Øn k·∫øt) `unit` of `professionals` focused on `1 objective at anytime`, `Product Goal`
- A `successful` Scrum Team `delivers value`
	- `Entire` Scrum Team is `accountable` for `creating` a `valuable`, `useful Increment` every Sprint.
	- They deliver product `iteratively` and `incrementally`
	- In order to `provide value`, `Increment` must be `usable`.
	- To `maximize opportunities` => get `feedbacks`
	- A `successful` Scrum Team `releases frequently`, and `measures` the value customers/users `experience`.
- The Scrum Team is `responsible` for `all product-related activities` from `stakeholder`
	- `Collaboration` (c·ªông t√°c), `verification` (x√°c nh·∫≠n), `maintenance` (duy tr√¨), `operation` (v·∫≠n h√†nh), `experimentation` (th·ª≠ nghi·ªám), `research` (nguy√™n c·ª©u) and `development` (ph√°t tri·ªÉn), and `anything` else that might be required.
- `Each person` can have many `different accountabilities`
	- `Developer` can also be `Product Owner` or 1 `Scrum Master`
- Scrum Guide define `each Sprint have at least 1 Increment and reach Sprint Goal`
	- `No punishment` if Scrum Team `can't` do that
	- `Sprint Retrospective` should `take lesson` for that.
	- `All` `Developer` are `responsible for quality`
	- Each `Product Increment` needs to be `tested` and ready for `release` `according` `Definition of Done` .
- `Scrum Team engages Stakeholders` during the Sprint

## Characteristic

- üí° NO `sub-teams` or `hierarchies` (Ph√¢n c·∫•p).

### Cross-functional

- Members have `all the skills necessary` to `create value` each Sprint.
- Have enough to `accomplish work`
- üí° Enough "technical expertise"

### Self-managing

- They `internally decide` `who` does `what`, `when`, and `how`.
- They are `structured` and `empowered` (ƒë∆∞·ª£c trao quy·ªÅn) `by organization` to `manage` their `own work`.
- Should try to `solve most problems on its own`.
	- Not directed by outside.
	- May require help from the Scrum Master or other parts of the organization
- Benefit:
	- Increased `creativity`
	- Increased `self-accountability`
	- Increased `commitment`.
- `Product Owner` and `Scrum Master` don't manage `Developer` team

### Scrum Team‚Äôs size

- `Small enough` to remain `nimble` (s·ª± nhanh nh·∫πn) ‚áí flexible
	- `Smaller` teams `communicate better` and are `more productive`
- `Large enough` to `complete` significant `work`
- üí° But no limit, just recommend
- Typically `10 or fewer` people.
```
4 ‚â§ size ‚â§ 10
> 10 members = increase coordination & complexity
```
- If team is `too big`
	- They should consider `reorganizing` into `multiple` cohesive `Scrum Teams`, each `focused on same product`.
		- Same `Product Goal`, `Product Backlog`, and `Product Owner`.
	- Become `Scaled Team`
	- Team can be broken into smaller `Scrum Team`s
- `Members/size` of Scrum Team is `changed`
	- At the `end of the Sprint`
	- `Agreed` with the `Scrum Team`
	- Taking a `reduction` (gi·∫£m s√∫t) in `productivity`.

## Velocity (t·ªëc ƒë·ªô) of Scrum Team

- Working in Sprints at a `sustainable pace` (t·ªëc ƒë·ªô ·ªïn ƒë·ªãnh) `improves` the Scrum Team‚Äôs `focus` and `consistency` (nh·∫•t qu√°n).
- `Velocity` = `amount of work completed` in a Sprint
	- Completed work is `100%` Done
- We `forecast` the `velocity` of Sprint by `average of velocity` over previous Sprints.
	- Use `past performance` of Sprints
	- `Help` `Developer` to `decide` `how much work` to select for Sprint
	- There isn't `maximum` or `minimum`
	- Implement `Empiricism`
- `Velocity` is `different` from `Capacity` (c√¥ng su·∫•t)
- `NOT` a mandatory metric in Scrum
	- `NOT` directly connected to value of the Product
	- `NOT` for product owner to decide about value

### 1st three Sprints

- üí° Create an Increment with every Sprint.
- Each Increment should `contain` a `working` and `releasable functionality`, even if it is `minimal`.

## Technical debt

- `Technical debt` is something `should` be `continually dealt` with and `not postponed` (ho√£n l·∫°i)
	- Because Scrum Team `doesn't fix bad decision from past`
	- `Velocity` is `impacted` by Technical debt
- `Developer` `collaborate` with `Product Owner` to deal with Technical debt every sprint
- Technical debt `reduces` `transparency`, as it may `impact` the ability to `release` the Product Increment.

# Scrum Master

- `Scrum Master` is `accountable` for `establishing Scrum` as defined in the `Scrum Guide`.
- They do this by `helping everyone understand Scrum`, both within `Scrum Team` and `Organization`.
	- Theory
	- Practices
	- Values
	- Rules

	- `Stand in way` of reaching `Sprint goal`.
	- `Prevent team` from delivering a `high quality product` and `improving` their `performance`.
- üí° When `team cannot resolve the issue` and impact is significant, it `becomes an impediment`.
	- it is impacting their productivity.
- `Causing` the `removal` (s·ª± lo·∫°i b·ªè) of `impediments` to the `Scrum Team‚Äôs progress`.
	- Deal with impediment at `Organizational level`.

## The Scrum Master serves the `Developer`

- If `Developers` are `unhappy` because `requirements` are `not clear enough`, `facilitate` a `discussion` around this concern and find ways to bring `clarity` to `Product Backlog`
- If Developer `team is too big`, Scrum Master `asks` the `developers` to `find` a `way to divide themselves` into teams.
- `Warn` and `coach` Scrum Team to `take ownership of Product` they build `as a team`.

	- `Facilitates` the `collaborations` between `Scrum Team` and `Stakeholders`

# Developer

- The Daily Scrum is only for the Developers.

- `Developers` are `committed` to `creating` any aspect of a `usable` `Product Increment` each `Sprint`.
- `Development work` = `any work` required to `build a product`
	- Development team ·ªü ƒë√¢y kh√¥ng ch·ªâ c√≥ k·ªπ s∆∞ ph·∫ßn m·ªÅm m√† c√≤n bao g·ªìm t·∫•t c·∫£ m·ªçi th√†nh ph·∫ßn tham gia qu√° tr√¨nh ph√°t tri·ªÉn d·ª± √°n, c√≥ th·ªÉ l√† designers, programmers, writers,‚Ä¶
	- Programmer, Designer, Tester, Business Analyst are Developer

	- Developer has `all the skills` needed to `develop Product`
	- Developer isn't only Programmer
	- Developer is `cross-functional`
    	- If a `position is missed`, Product `still be developed`

## Accountability

- `Decide` how to `turn` `Product Backlog`Item into `Increment`.
- `Instilling` (n√¢ng cao) quality by `adhering` (tu√¢n th·ªß) to `Definition of Done`.
	- `Don‚Äôt` refer to `Definition of Done` as a `checklist`, even if it may `look like one`.
- `All` Developers are `accountable for Increment`, not 1 person
- Developers doing the work are `responsible` for `testing` and `quality`.
	- There is `no "tester"` accountability within the Scrum Team.
	- `Raise` this as an `impediment` which may require the assistance of `Scrum Master` to resolve.

### Adapt the Sprint Backlog

- Creating a `plan` for `Sprint` , the `Sprint Backlog`
- `Modify Sprint Backlog during Sprint` with collaboration of `Product Owner`

### Monitor the Sprint progress

- `Adapting` their plan `each day` toward the `Sprint Goal`

### Self-managing

- `All` Developers are `accountable` for the `work performed`, `even` if it is `distributed among them`.
	- There are `no hand-offs` between them.
	- `If a person doesn't handle` own work, `all` Developers have `accountable` for that.
- `Holding` each `other accountable` as `professionals`.
- `No one` even CEO `tell` them `how to work`
- They `never pass` from 1 person `to other`
- Take `ownership` of `entire development process`

### Talk with Stakeholder

- Developers `directly talk` with `Stakeholder` `anytime` it makes sense

### Estimate Product Backlog Item

- `Development` Team `estimates` work in Scrum

## Business Analyst

- Business Analyst is responsible for bridging the gap between development and business side

	- `Sole` (duy nh·∫•t) person accountable
	- `Any change` of `Product Backlog`need `through Product Owner`
	- `No one even stakeholders` allow to decide which features should be built and ordered

- `Ensuring` that `Product Backlog` is `transparent`, `visible` and `understood`.
- `Any requirements` related to the Product are `added` to `Product Backlog`.
	- Even it is defect, bug, new criteria, non-functional requirement, etc.
- The Product Owner `cannot` modify `Sprint Backlog`.
	- That is the responsibility of the Developers.
	- `Through discussion` with `Product Owner`, `Developers select items` from the Product Backlog items to include in the current Sprint.

### Make decision

- For `Product Owners` to `succeed`, the `entire organization` must `respect` their `decisions`.

## Cancel Sprint

- `Only` Product Owner has the authority to `cancel a Sprint`.

# Scaling Scrum

- Scaling Scrum = multiple `Scrum Team`  work on `1 Product`
	- Faster development pace (t·ªëc ƒë·ªô)
	- More output
	- More value

- üí° Same rules with Normal Scrum

## Sprint

- Multiple Scrum Teams can have `different sprint lengths`.
	- The sprints can also have `different start dates, end dates`.
- 1 team is `end the sprint`, they must `collaborate` with the other to ensure `least 1 increment has been created`.
	- The `only` requirement is to have an `integrated Product Increment` by the end of the Sprint.
- It‚Äôs `easier` if `sprints of each Scrum Teams` are `aligned` (cƒÉn ch·ªânh ho√†n to√†n) or partially aligned (cƒÉn ch·ªânh 1 ph·∫ßn).
	- For example, one Scrum team can have a four-week sprint and another Scrum team, two-week sprint.
	- At least every four weeks, their sprints will end and start at the same time.

## Scrum Artifact

### Product Backlog

- Scrum Teams have `same Product`
	- ‚áí Same `Product Backlog`
	- ‚áí Same `Product Owner` 
	- ‚áí Same `Definition of Done` 
    

### Sprint Backlog

- Each team has separate `Sprint Backlog` to pull items from Product Backlog in `agreement` with `other` teams and `Product Owner`.
	- Each team has a `separate Sprint Goal`

- üí° The are no Integration Sprints in Scrum.

### Product Increment

- Scaling Scrum should have a common `Definition of Done`
	- `Every Increment` of Scaling Scrum applies `same Definition of Done`.
	- `All teams have integration responsibility` to build final Product version, not a single pieces.
	- This is `a necessary task in Sprint Backlog` of each team.
- Create & share `Definition of Done` before starting Sprint.
- The `best way` for multiple Scrum Teams to `produce` (s·∫£n xu·∫•t) `integrated Product Increments` is for `each team` to work `throughout all components` of the application.

## Scrum Team

- `Velocity` will most likely `decrease` as the `existing team` (not new team) will need to invest `some additional time` to `collaborate with new team`.
- `Multiple Scrum Teams` have conversations about `integrating` their work `as often as needed`, even `multiple times during day`.
- The teams need to collaborate to produce Increments.
	- `Dependencies` between them `slow down the work`, `increase` the `communication overhead`.
- üí° `Reduce as much as possible` dependencies between the teams.
- Make the `dependencies` between `Product Backlog Items` `transparent`.
- While eliminating (lo·∫°i b·ªè) dependencies may be desirable (ƒë√°ng mong mu·ªën), it is `rarely possible`.

- `Rotating people` between different teams is `rarely` a `good` idea.

### Product Owner

- Product Owner should `collaborate with teams` to `identify dependencies` and find ways to `reduce` or `eliminate` them.

### Scrum Master

- üí° Each team has 1 Scrum Master
- `NOT REQUIRE` can share `same Scrum Master`

### Component Team

- A `layer` or a `component` is just `1 part` of the `product` responsible for performing a `specific function`.
- A `component team` (layer team) is `focused` on a `single component` or layer of the system.
	- A component team `alone` will typically `not` be able to `deliver new functionalities` that fulfill a customer's need.

### Feature Team

- Work through `ALL` development `layers` to fulfill a customer need.
	- A feature team is `cross-functional` and `cross-component` because it has `all the skills needed to complete a feature`.
- The `feature-oriented team` model is `preferred` to the `component-oriented team` model.
- When `move` from `Component Team` to `Feature Team`
	- `Productivity` may `suffer` when making this kind of move.
	- Getting `support from business side first` helps.
	- Feature teams have `less communication` overhead.
