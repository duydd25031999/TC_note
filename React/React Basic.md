# React Basic

## Virtual DOM

- `The virtual DOM` (VDOM) is a programming `concept` that `representation of a UI` is kept in `memory` and `synced` with the `‚Äúreal‚Äù DOM` by a `library` such as ReactDOM.
    - The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.
- Virtual DOM is a `lightweight JavaScript data format` that is used to `represent` the `content` of the `DOM` at a given `point in time`.
    - It has all the `same properties` as the `DOM` but is `not` as `interoperable` as the DOM.
    - When the `state changes`, `update` the `Virtual DOM first` and then `find` the `corresponding element` on the `real DOM` and to `re-render only it`.
- React `abstracts` away the `DOM` from you, giving a `simpler programming model` and `better performance`.

### Shadow DOM

<aside>
üí° A Shadow DOM is a `hidden DOM` which can be `attached` to any element `inside real DOM`.

</aside>

- `The Shadow DOM` is a `browser technology` designed primarily for `scoping variables` and `CSS` in `web components`.
- It works `like a normal DOM`.
- In Shadow DOM, `all of its markup and style will be scoped`.
- It refers to the browser‚Äôs potential to `add` a `subtree of DOM elements` into the `rendering of a document`, but `not` into the `DOM tree` of the `main document`.

| Virtual DOM | Shadow DOM |
| --- | --- |
| It revolves around solving performance issues. | It revolves around the concept of encapsulation. |
| It is a complete representation of an actual DOM.	 | It is not a complete representation of the entire DOM. |
| It groups together several changes and does a single re-render instead of many small ones.	 | It adds a subtree of DOM elements into the rendering of a document, instead of adding it to the main document‚Äôs DOM tree. |
| It creates a copy of the whole DOM object.	 | It creates small pieces of the DOM object having their own, isolated scope. |
| It does not isolate the DOM.	 | It isolates the DOM. |
| It does not help with CSS scoping.	 | It helps with CSS scoping. |

## Render function

- Every React component is `required` to have the `render()` function.
- The `render()` function `returns only` the `React element`.
- The `render()` function is a specific `description of the UI` at `any given time`.
- So if the `data changes`, React will perform the `UI update` with the `corresponding data`.
- When the data changes, React will `automatically call` the `render()` function to update the UI.

### JSX

- JSX is a `syntax extension` to Javascript `used in ReactJS` that allows writing `Javascript` that looks `similar to HTML`.
- `After the compilation`, the JSX is translated to `React.createElement` calls.
- JSX just provides `syntactic sugar` for the `React.createElement(component, props, ...children)` function.
- Using JSX to create `HTML elements` as a `JavaScript code`, that will be `placed inside the DOM without` using `createElement()` or `appendChild()` methods.

# React Lifecycle

- There are 3 phases of React Lifecycle.

## 1. Mounting

- G√°n component v√†o trong Virtual DOM, t·ª´ ƒë√≥ render compoent l·∫ßn ƒë·∫ßu ti√™n

----

- Putting elements into the DOM.
- Mounting occurs when the component is placed on the DOM container and the component is rendered on a webpage.
- React has 4 built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

### 1.1. `constructor`

```jsx
constructor(props)
```

- This stage requires the developer to define properties and the initial state of the component.

### 1.2. `static getDerivedStateFromProps`

```jsx
static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)
```

- This function transforms value of props into a state of component.
    - Update state based on props.
- It is invoked right before calling the render method, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates.
- It should return an object to update the state, or¬†`null` to update nothing.
- Deriving state leads to verbose code and makes your components difficult to think about.

### 1.3. `render`

```jsx
render()
```

- Render elements to DOM node.

### 1.4. `componentDidMount`

```jsx
componentDidMount()
```

- Is invoked immediately after a component is mounted.
    - If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request.
- Calling¬†`setState()`¬†immediately ****in¬†`componentDidMount()` will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen.
    - This guarantees that even though the¬†`render()`¬†will be called twice in this case, the user won‚Äôt see the intermediate state.
    - Use this pattern with caution because it often causes performance issues.

## 2. Updating

- Render l·∫°i component khi state, prop, context c·ªßa component thay ƒë·ªïi

----

- A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.
- React has 5 built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

### 2.1. `static getDerivedStateFromProps`

- Updates state from value of props.

### 2.2. `shouldComponentUpdate`

- Check state or properties changed or not to decide to update UI or not.

### 2.3. `render()`

- Re-render UI after deciding to updates component.

### 2.4. `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`

```jsx
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
```

- Invoked right before the most recently rendered output is committed.
- It enables component to capture some information from the DOM before it is potentially changed.
- Any value returned by this lifecycle method will be passed as a parameter to `componentDidUpdate()`.
    - It may occur in UIs like a chat thread that need to handle scroll position in a special way.
- A snapshot value (or¬†`null`) should be returned.

```jsx
class ScrollingList extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.listRef = React.createRef();
  }

  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // Are we adding new items to the list?
    // Capture the scroll position so we can adjust scroll later.
    if (prevProps.list.length < this.props.list.length) {
      const list = this.listRef.current;
      return list.scrollHeight - list.scrollTop;
    }
    return null;
  }

  componentDidUpdate(
		prevProps, 
		prevState, 
		snapshot? // returned from getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
	) {
    // If we have a snapshot value, we've just added new items.
    // Adjust scroll so these new items don't push the old ones out of view.
    // (snapshot here is the value returned from getSnapshotBeforeUpdate)
    if (snapshot !== null) {
      const list = this.listRef.current;
      list.scrollTop = list.scrollHeight - snapshot;
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div ref={this.listRef}>{/* ...contents... */}</div>
    );
  }
}
```

### 2.5. `componentDidUpdate`

```jsx
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)
```

- Called after a component is re-rendered.
- Use this as an opportunity to interact with the DOM when the component has been updated.
- This is also a good place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props.

## 3. Unmounting

- Qu√° tr√¨nh x√≥a component kh·ªèi Virtual DOM

----

- A component is detached from the DOM container.
- React has only 1 built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:

### 3.1. `componentWillUnmount()`

- Is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.
- You¬†should not call¬†**`setState()`**¬†in¬†`componentWillUnmount()`¬†because the component will never be re-rendered.

## State

- Ch·ª©c nƒÉng qu·∫£n l√Ω d·ªØ li·ªáu c·ªßa component theo kh√°i ni·ªám b·∫•t bi·∫øn (immutability)
- State s·∫Ω kh√¥ng ƒë∆∞·ª£c g√°n gi√° tr·ªã tr·ª±c ti·∫øp m√† ph·∫£i th√¥ng qua h√†m setState

----

### setState

- `setState()` schedules an update to a component‚Äôs state object.
- `setState()`¬†enqueues changes to the component state and tells React that this component and its children need to be re-rendered with the updated state.
- When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.
    - `setState()` will always lead to a re-render unless¬†`shouldComponentUpdate()`¬†returns¬†`false`.
- Think of¬†`setState()`¬†as a¬†request¬†rather than an immediate command to update the component.
    - For better perceived performance, React may delay it, and then update several components in a single pass.
    - `setState()` does not always immediately update the component.
    - This makes reading `this.state` right after calling `setState()` a potential pitfall.
- Argument of `setState` can be new value of state or updater function.

```jsx
(state, props) => stateChange
```

- `state` is a reference to the component state at the time the change is being applied.
    - It should not be directly mutated.
- Call `setState` instead of directly changing the state value.
    - `setState` helps to control of the state across all components.
    - If update it directly, calling the `setState()` afterward may just replace the update you made.
    - When directly update the state, it does not change `this.state` immediately.
    - Instead, it creates a pending state transition, and accessing it after calling this method will only return the present value.

### state & props

- In React, both `this.props` and `this.state` represent the rendered values.
- `props` are passed into the component
- `props`¬†should be not changed
- `state` is created in the component
- `state` is changeable

## Ref

- Qu·∫£n l√Ω d·ªØ li·ªáu ƒë·ªôc l·∫≠p v·ªõi v√≤ng ƒë·ªùi c·ªßa React
- Khi thay ƒë·ªïi gi√° tr·ªã kh√¥ng l√†m React Component update

------

- Ref object stores data independently with component.
    - When changing its data, not trigger re-render component.
    - When re-rendering component, ref object still holds its value.
- `ref.current` holds its current value.
- To access the DOM node, use `createRef` to create a variable that reference to DOM node via `ref` props.
- There are a few good use cases for refs:
    - Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
    - Triggering imperative animations.
    - Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.
- When a ref is passed to an element in¬†`render`, a reference to the node becomes accessible at the¬†`current`¬†attribute of the ref.

## Context

- Truy·ªÅn d·ªØ li·ªáu qua nhi·ªÅu t·∫ßng component h∆°n l√† s·ª≠ d·ª•ng Props ch·ªâ ƒë∆∞·ª£c 1-1
- M·ªói Context g·ªìm 2 component
  - Provider: L∆∞u tr·ªØ 

----

- Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without passing props down manually at every level.
- Context data is passed down on the¬†`value`prop using the¬†`Context.Provider` component. It can be consumed using the `Context.Consumer` component or the¬†`contentType` static property of class.
1. Create context variable using `React.createContext()`
2. Use provider of this context as a Container inside Parent component.
3. Pass state into context via value prop of provider.
4. In deeply nested component, assign context into static property name `contextType`
5. Use context value via `context` attribute of class.

```
// Context lets us pass a value deep into the component tree
// without explicitly threading it through every component.
// Create a context for the current theme (with "light" as the default).
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light'); // [1]

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Use a Provider to pass the current theme to the tree below.
    // Any component can read it, no matter how deep it is.
    // In this example, we're passing "dark" as the current value.
    return (
			{/* [2] + [3] */}
      <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
        <Toolbar />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}

// A component in the middle doesn't have to
// pass the theme down explicitly anymore.
function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}

class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
  // Assign a contextType to read the current theme context.
  // React will find the closest theme Provider above and use its value.
  // In this example, the current theme is "dark".
  static contextType = ThemeContext; // [4]
  render() {
		{/* [5] */}
    return <Button theme={this.context} />;
  }
}

```

# Hook concept

## Concept

- Hooks are backwards-compatible.
- Hooks are functions that let you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React state and lifecycle features from functional components.
- They let using React without classes.

### Problems with React class component

- **It‚Äôs hard to reuse stateful logic between components.**
    - React doesn‚Äôt offer a way to ‚Äúattach‚Äù reusable behavior to a component.
    - Class components design use render props and higher-order components that try to solve this.
    - *Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing component hierarchy.*
- **Complex components become hard to understand.**
    - Old lifecycle has many status ‚áí when fetching data will be scattered.
    - Components might perform some data fetching in `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`. However, the same¬†`componentDidMount`method might also contain some unrelated logic that sets up event listeners, with cleanup performed in `componentWillUnmount`.
    - *Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data).*
- **Classes confuse both people and machines.**
    - People can understand props, state, and top-down data flow perfectly well but still struggle with classes.
    - The distinction between function and class components in React and when to use each one leads to disagreements even between experienced React developers.
    - *Hooks let you use more of React‚Äôs features without classes.*

## Local state

- Local state is data we manage in one or another component.
- Local state is most often managed in React using the¬†`useState`¬†or `useReducer`.

## Global state

- Global state is data we manage across multiple components.
- Global state is necessary when we want to get and update data anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at least.

## Server state

- Data that comes from an external server that must be integrated with our UI state.
- Server state is a simple concept, but can be hard to manage alongside all of our local and global UI state.

## URL state

- Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query parameters.
- Using React Router, get all the information using¬†`useHistory` or¬†`useLocation`.

# useState

- Hook to manage state of functional component.
- Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.
- React may group several state updates into a single re-render to improve performance. Normally, this improves performance and shouldn‚Äôt affect your application‚Äôs behavior.

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

// only add new value => pass new value
setState(newValue) => newState

// Functional updates
// If the new state is computed using the previous state
// You can pass a callback to setState.
setState(prevState => {
  // Object.assign would also work
	// Return new value
  return {...prevState, ...updatedValues};
});
```

## **Lazy initial state**

- If the initial state is the result of an expensive computation, you may provide a function instead of inital value.

```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(() => {
  const initialState = someExpensiveComputation(props);
  return initialState;
});
```

## **Bailing out of a state update**

- If you update a State Hook to the same value as the current state, React will bail out without rendering the children or firing effects.
- React may still need to render that specific component again before bailing out.
    - That shouldn‚Äôt be a concern because React won‚Äôt unnecessarily go ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù into the tree.

# useEffect

- The¬†*Effect Hook* perform side effects in functional components
    - Run after React has mounted or updated the DOM.
    - `useEffect` Hook as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
- `useEffect` called inside a component
    - Functional component is before rendering.
    - `useEffect` register a callback for after rendering.
    - Placing¬†`useEffect` inside the component lets us access state variable (or any props) right from the effect.
- `useEffect` return function | undefined
    - return function is Cleanup,  equivalent to `componentDidUnmount`
    - React¬†also cleans up effects from the previous render before running the effects next time.
    - Cleanup is used for clear subcriptions + setInternal + setTimeout.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
	...
	return cleanupCallback;
}, [dependencies]); 
```

- Called when dependencies change + after re-render
- `dependencies` used for filter states ‚áí auto call when changing filters
- Dependencies is `undefined` ‚áí always called after re-render.
- Dependencies is empty array ‚áí call only one time

```jsx
MOUNTING
- rendering
- run useEffect()
UPDATING
- rendering
- run `useEffect() cleanup` if dependencies is changed.
- run `useEffect()` if dependencies is changed.
UNMOUNTING
- run `useEffect() cleanup`.
```

# useContext

- Accepts a context object (the value returned from¬†`React.createContext`) and returns the current context value for that context.
    - The current context value is determined by the¬†`value` prop of the nearest `<MyContext.Provider>` above the calling component in the tree.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ProviderContext = React.createContext();

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ProviderContext.Provider value={{ color: 'red' }}>
      <div className='App'>
        <ChildComponent />
      </div>
    </ProviderContext.Provider>
  );
};

const ChildComponent = () => {
  const inject = React.useContext(ProviderContext);

  return <p style={{ inject.color }}>This text is {color}</p>;
};

export default App;
```

import React from 'react';

const ProviderContext = React.createContext();

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ProviderContext.Provider value={{ color: 'red' }}>
      <div className='App'>
        <ChildComponent />
      </div>
    </ProviderContext.Provider>
  );
};

const ChildComponent = () => {
  const inject = React.useContext(ProviderContext);

  return <p style={{ inject.color }}>This text is {color}</p>;
};

export default App;
```
