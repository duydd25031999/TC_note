- Kh√¥ng cho khai b√°o bi·∫øn m√† kh√¥ng c√≥ var
- Functional reference datatype trong js

```jsx
function a() {}
var b = a;
console.log(typeof b); //function
```

## Define function

### Function regular declaration

```jsx
function foo() {...}
```

### Function expression

<aside>
üí° Function is a Reference Data Type

</aside>

- **Anonymous Function**¬†is a function that does not have any name associated with it.
    - Normally we use the¬†`function`¬†keyword before the function name to define a function in JavaScript.
    - However, in anonymous functions, we use only the¬†`function`¬†keyword without the function name.
- An anonymous function is not accessible after its initial creation.
    - It can only be accessed by a variable it is stored in as a¬†functional value.
    - An anonymous function can also have multiple arguments, but only one expression.
- If binding the method directly to a variable, it will be easier to find the implementation and will stop issues with global scope where function names could conflict.

```jsx
var foo = function() {...}
```

### Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

- Self-invoking function expression.
- Function that runs as soon as it is defined.

```jsx
(function() {...})()
```

## Function prototype

### a**pply**

- Invokes the function with a given¬†`this`¬†value and allows you to pass arguments as an array.

```jsx
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
  console.log(
    greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
  );
}

invite.apply(employee1, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.apply(employee2, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

### call

- The `call()` method invokes a function with a given¬†`this` value and arguments provided one by one

```jsx
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
  console.log(
    greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
  );
}

invite.call(employee1, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.call(employee2, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

### **bind**

- Returns a new function, allowing to pass arguments like original function.
- Doesn‚Äôt execute it immediately.
- Allow to define `this` object actively.

```jsx
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
  console.log(
    greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
  );
}

var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
inviteEmployee1("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
inviteEmployee2("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
```

## ****Arrow function (ES6)****

- An arrow function is a shorter syntax for a function expression.
- It does not have its own `this` object, `arguments` array, `super`, or `new.target` like normal function.
    - It take the closest `this` object as its `this`.

```jsx
var a = function(...arg) {...}
var a = (...arg) => {...}

var a = function(...arg) {
    return result
}
var a = (...arg) => result

var adder = {
    base: 1,

    add: function(a) {
        var f = v => v + this.base; // the closest this is adder
        return f(a);
    }
};
console.log(adder.add(1));
```

## Strict mode

- strict mode: ch·∫ø ƒë·ªô nghi√™m ng·∫∑t

---

- Strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions.
- Strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
- Strict mode fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations
    - Strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that‚Äôs not strict mode.
- Strict mode prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.
- It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).
- It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.
- Strict mode makes it easier to write ‚Äúsecure‚Äù JavaScript.
- strict mode is disallowing the implicit auto-global variable declaration from omitting the var.

```jsx
function foo() {
	"use strict";
	// this code is strict mode
	function bar() {
		// this code is strict mode
	}
}
// this code isn't strict mode
```
