1. Crawling: 
    - Google downloads text, images, and videos from pages it found on the internet with automated programs called crawlers.
1. Indexing: 
    - Google analyzes the text, images, and video files on the page, and stores the information in the Google index, which is a large database.
1. Serving search results: 
    - When a user searches on Google, Google returns information that's relevant to the user's query.
