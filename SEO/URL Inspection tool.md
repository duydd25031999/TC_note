- This is one of the most important debugging tools to understand why page might not be appearing the way that expect in Search results.

# Dashboard

## Tab: "GOOGLE INDEX"

- If the page can be indexed by Google
- This runs a test against the live page for information similar to the indexed URL.
- See a live rendered version of page by Google.
