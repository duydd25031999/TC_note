### Excercise 2

1. Tự liệt kê các từ liên quan tới câu hỏi
	- State "responsibility": government, official, law, nation, community provision, ...
	- Support from the church: Church, religious, parish (giáo xứ), voluntary groups, charity, ...
2. Scanning những từ liên quan tới câu hỏi: Bước 1 chỉ là brainstorming ban đầu, dựa vào đó để scanning
	- In all societies there are groups of people who are potentially vulnerable. These include children, older people, people with disabilities, and the poor, for example. Whether they are supported and how they are supported, however, varies from society to society and at different times in history.
	- In some societies, the "care" of the vulnerable is seen as the "responsibility" of the "family" or the "village". In others, it is principally the "responsibility" of the "state", through "community provision". In "Israeli kibbutzim", for example, the "care" of children is seen as the "responsibility" of the whole "community", and not principally the concern of the birth parents. In other societies the "care" of children is the prime "responsibility" of their "parents", and in some it is the "responsibility" of the "extended family". Attitudes to the vulnerable vary. Those on benefits may be seen as 'lazy scroungers', or their situation may be seen as the result of poor parenting or the inevitable consequence of economic changes. The response to their need will vary according to the dominant attitudes in the society, the views and priorities of government, the wealth of the "nation", and how that wealth is distributed and managed.
	- In England, the state has had some involvement in providing for the poor since Elizabethan times. The "1601 Poor Law" allowed "officials" to collect money from each household in their parish and to distribute it to the needy. However, it was thought that the poor only had themselves to blame. The "political approach" at the time was informed by a view that the "government" should not interfere in the workings of the economy or in the provision of welfare services. The "church" and other "voluntary groups" provided "charitable support", but the state 'left well alone'. Not until the opening years of the twentieth century did the "state" begin to take a proactive role in the "care" and welfare of its "citizens".

	- So far in this chapter, we have questioned common-sense ideas held about what is sickness and health and have raised some challenging questions about these ideas. However, we can go further and question a closely related concept upon which notions of "illness" are ultimately based: the concept of "the body".
	- All of us exist in "bodies" that are "objectively" different shapes, heights, "colours" and physical "abilities"; they are also "subjectively" valued as attractive or ugly, young or old, short or tall, weak or strong.
	- Let us look first at the "objective differences". The "two" most common explanations for "objective" differences between "bodies" are, first, that people's "bodies" vary according to genetic differences (height, weight, etc.) and, second, that "bodies" change as people age. However "sociologists" point out that the shapes of people's "bodies" are often actually linked to diets, "type of employment" and general quality of life. A huge range of research indicates that poorer people are more likely to:
		- eat 'unhealthy' foods and to smoke cigarettes
		- be employed in repetitive, physically demanding work or the other extreme of boring, sedentary employment
		- have worse housing conditions
		- live in more deprived neighbourhoods
	- All of these factors impact upon the condition of a person's "body" and health. We can see then that the physical shapes of "bodies" are strongly influenced by social factors.

	- The "Family Allowance Act 1945" introduced a "financial payment" for children under "15". This did not apply for the "first" child but applied for all subsequent children.
	- The "National Insurance Act 1946" allowed for the "payment" of "unemployment benefit, sickness benefit and retirement pension, maternity benefit and widow's pension" for all who, when in work, paid "weekly" from their wages into the "national" insurance scheme.
	- The "National Assistance Act 1948" provided a "safety net - a minimum income" for people who did "not pay into the national insurance scheme" and were, therefore, not eligible for those "benefits".
	- The "National Health Service Act 1948". Before the introduction of the "National Health Service (NHS)", if people needed to see a "doctor or have hospital treatment" they normally had to "pay". A "national" service was central to the "post-war" welfare reforms and was based on "three" principles:
		1. That "health services" should be "free" to all at the "point of delivery" (when they are actually used).
		2. That the "service" would be truly "national", covering the whole "population" in all parts of the country.
		3. That access to "services" would be based on clinical "need" (not on the ability to "pay").

	- The rising problem of obesity has helped to make "diabetes treatments" the biggest drug bill in primary care, with almost "£600 million of medicines" prescribed by doctors "last year", according to the "NHS Information Centre".
	- Analysts said that young people contracting the condition, which is often associated with obesity, were helping to push up "costs" as doctors tried to improve their long-term control of the disease and prevent complications.
	- A "total of 32.9 million diabetes drugs, costing £599.3 million", were prescribed in the "past financial year". In "2004-05" there were "24.8 million, costing £458 million". More than "90 per cent of the 2.4 million diabetics in England" have "type 2 diabetes", with the remainder suffering from "type 1", the "insulin-dependent form of the disease". There are thought to be "500,000 undiagnosed cases of diabetes".
	- While "rates of type 1" have shown slight increases in "recent years", "type 2" has risen far more rapidly - a trend linked to the increasing number of people who are overweight or obese. Almost "one in four adults in England" is obese, with predictions that "nine in ten" will be overweight or obese "by 2050". Obesity "costs the NHS £4.2 billion annually". This year the Government started a "£375 million campaign" aimed at preventing people from becoming overweight by encouraging them to eat better and exercise more.
	- An "NHS Information Centre spokeswoman" who worked on the report, which was published yesterday, said that "diabetes" was dominating the primary care "drug bill" as better monitoring identified more sufferers and widely used medications for other conditions such as statins became cheaper. She said that the data suggested a growing use of "injectable insulin in type 2 diabetes care", which was helping to push up "costs".
	- Doctors agreed that more expensive "long-acting insulin", which can "cost about £30 per item", was being used more often, as well as more "expensive pills" and other agents.
	- The report, an update of the centre's "June" publication "Prescribing for Diabetes in England", shows that the number of "insulin items" prescribed "last year" rose by "300,000 to 5.5 million", at a "total cost of £288.3 million". It marked an "8 per cent rise on the £267 million spent in the previous year". However, while the number of "anti-diabetic drugs", which are mostly in tablet form, also rose, the "cost" dropped slightly to "£168.1 million".
	- '"Type" 2 is increasing. We are seeing it in younger people, and because it is a progressive disease, people are needing an increasing number of interventions as time goes by, the spokeswoman said, adding that "long-acting insulins" such as "Glargine" were now common. 'For people who are struggling to control their "type 2 diabetes" it makes sense, but it is quite a big clinical change "from five or ten years ago".
	- Other "anti-diabetic items", such as use of the subcutaneous "injection exenatide", have also increased and "cost £14.3 million". "Laurence Buckman", chairman of the "British Medical Association"'s general practice committee, said that he had observed a trend with drugs such as "exenatide", which "costs £80 per item". He said that younger patients could start on cheaper tablets such as "metformin", which "costs £3.70 per box", but were needing increasingly sophisticated treatments to keep their condition in check.
	- 'You are talking about an ever larger number of people getting a large range of drugs to reduce long-term complications. "Type 2" is a common chronic illness that is getting commoner. It's in everyone's interest to treat people early and with the most "effective drugs", and these are the more expensive tablets and "long-acting insulins",' he said.
