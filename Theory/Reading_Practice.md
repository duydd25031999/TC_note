# Scanning Strategy

## Concept

### Level 1: Basic Scanning (The "Search Engine" Mode)

The Knowledge:

- **What to scan for:** Proper nouns (names of people/places), dates, numbers, and capitalized words. These rarely change between the text and the question.

- **The Technique:** 
    - Don't read left-to-right. 
    - Move your eyes purely vertically or diagonally (zig-zag) down the page. 
    - Your brain should not "pronounce" the word
    - It should just "pattern match" the shape of the target word.

Application to Tables/Diagrams:

1. Look at the **Headings** of the table or the **Title** of the diagram.
2. Find those exact words in the text.
3. Draw a box around that paragraph. **Stop scanning.** The answers are likely inside that box.

### Level 2: Intermediate Scanning (The "Synonym Hunter")

The Knowledge:

- **The Trap:** The table might say "Characteristics," but the text says "Features" or "Qualities." The table says "Farming methods," but the text discusses "Agricultural practices."

- **The Technique:** Before you look at the text, look at the Table/Diagram keywords and instantly brainstorm 2-3 synonyms in your head. Scan for *those* words too.

Application to Tables/Diagrams:

- **Row/Column Headers:** These are your "Anchors." 
    - If a row is labeled "Advantages," do not just look for the word "Advantages." 
    - Scan the text for positive words (*benefits, upside, pros, effective, useful*).

- **Gap Prediction:** Look at the gap. 
    - Is it a noun? A verb? A number? 
    - If the column heading is "Size" and the gap is "_____ cm," your eyes should ignore words and only stop on numbers/measurements.

### Level 3: Advanced Scanning (The "Structural Navigator")

The Knowledge:

- **Text Geography:** Tables and diagrams usually follow the order of the text (chronological or logical).
    - If you find the answer to Question 1 and Question 3, the answer to Question 2 **must** be physically between them in the text.
* **Signpost Words:** 
    - You scan for "transition signals" that indicate the information in the table.
    - Table implies a list? Scan for *First, Secondly, Finally, In addition*.
    - Diagram implies a process? Scan for *Then, After that, Subsequently*.

Application to Tables/Diagrams:

- **The "Sandwich" Method:**
    1. Find the answer to the question *before* the gap (Top Bread).
    2. Find the answer to the question *after* the gap (Bottom Bread).
    3. Scan *only* the small slice of text between them for the missing info. This reduces the text you need to read from 800 words to 20 words.

## 1. Completing tables and diagrams

### 1. Working out the meanings of words
- Word "don't know meaning" => look at "Context" => express "Same idea" in "Other words" or give clues to meaning
- Read whole text to guest meaning of "word"

### 2. Scanning a text for information

### 3. Recognising synonyms and antonyms in a text
