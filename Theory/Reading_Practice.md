#### Excercise 2

1. Tự liệt kê các từ liên quan tới câu hỏi
	- State "responsibility": government, official, law, nation, community provision, ...

2. Scanning những từ liên quan tới câu hỏi: Bước 1 chỉ là brainstorming ban đầu, dựa vào đó để scanning
	- In all societies there are groups of people who are potentially vulnerable. These include children, older people, people with disabilities, and the poor, for example. Whether they are supported and how they are supported, however, varies from society to society and at different times in history.
	- In some societies, the "care" of the vulnerable is seen as the "responsibility" of the "family" or the "village". In others, it is principally the "responsibility" of the "state", through "community provision". In "Israeli kibbutzim", for example, the "care" of children is seen as the "responsibility" of the whole "community", and not principally the concern of the birth parents. In other societies the "care" of children is the prime "responsibility" of their "parents", and in some it is the "responsibility" of the "extended family". Attitudes to the vulnerable vary. Those on benefits may be seen as 'lazy scroungers', or their situation may be seen as the result of poor parenting or the inevitable consequence of economic changes. The response to their need will vary according to the dominant attitudes in the society, the views and priorities of government, the wealth of the "nation", and how that wealth is distributed and managed.
	- In England, the state has had some involvement in providing for the poor since Elizabethan times. The "1601 Poor Law" allowed "officials" to collect money from each household in their parish and to distribute it to the needy. However, it was thought that the poor only had themselves to blame. The "political approach" at the time was informed by a view that the "government" should not interfere in the workings of the economy or in the provision of welfare services. The "church" and other "voluntary groups" provided "charitable support", but the state 'left well alone'. Not until the opening years of the twentieth century did the "state" begin to take a proactive role in the "care" and welfare of its "citizens".

	- So far in this chapter, we have questioned common-sense ideas held about what is sickness and health and have raised some challenging questions about these ideas. However, we can go further and question a closely related concept upon which notions of "illness" are ultimately based: the concept of "the body".
	- All of us exist in "bodies" that are "objectively" different shapes, heights, "colours" and physical "abilities"; they are also "subjectively" valued as attractive or ugly, young or old, short or tall, weak or strong.
	- Let us look first at the "objective differences". The "two" most common explanations for "objective" differences between "bodies" are, first, that people's "bodies" vary according to genetic differences (height, weight, etc.) and, second, that "bodies" change as people age. However "sociologists" point out that the shapes of people's "bodies" are often actually linked to diets, "type of employment" and general quality of life. A huge range of research indicates that poorer people are more likely to:
		- eat 'unhealthy' foods and to smoke cigarettes
		- be employed in repetitive, physically demanding work or the other extreme of boring, sedentary employment
		- have worse housing conditions
		- live in more deprived neighbourhoods
	- All of these factors impact upon the condition of a person's "body" and health. We can see then that the physical shapes of "bodies" are strongly influenced by social factors.

	- The "Family Allowance Act 1945" introduced a "financial payment" for children under "15". This did not apply for the "first" child but applied for all subsequent children.
	- The "National Insurance Act 1946" allowed for the "payment" of "unemployment benefit, sickness benefit and retirement pension, maternity benefit and widow's pension" for all who, when in work, paid "weekly" from their wages into the "national" insurance scheme.
	- The "National Assistance Act 1948" provided a "safety net - a minimum income" for people who did "not pay into the national insurance scheme" and were, therefore, not eligible for those "benefits".
	- The "National Health Service Act 1948". Before the introduction of the "National Health Service (NHS)", if people needed to see a "doctor or have hospital treatment" they normally had to "pay". A "national" service was central to the "post-war" welfare reforms and was based on "three" principles:
		1. That "health services" should be "free" to all at the "point of delivery" (when they are actually used).
		2. That the "service" would be truly "national", covering the whole "population" in all parts of the country.
		3. That access to "services" would be based on clinical "need" (not on the ability to "pay").

	- The rising problem of obesity has helped to make "diabetes treatments" the biggest drug bill in primary care, with almost "£600 million of medicines" prescribed by doctors "last year", according to the "NHS Information Centre".
	- Analysts said that young people contracting the condition, which is often associated with obesity, were helping to push up "costs" as doctors tried to improve their long-term control of the disease and prevent complications.
	- A "total of 32.9 million diabetes drugs, costing £599.3 million", were prescribed in the "past financial year". In "2004-05" there were "24.8 million, costing £458 million". More than "90 per cent of the 2.4 million diabetics in England" have "type 2 diabetes", with the remainder suffering from "type 1", the "insulin-dependent form of the disease". There are thought to be "500,000 undiagnosed cases of diabetes".
	- While "rates of type 1" have shown slight increases in "recent years", "type 2" has risen far more rapidly - a trend linked to the increasing number of people who are overweight or obese. Almost "one in four adults in England" is obese, with predictions that "nine in ten" will be overweight or obese "by 2050". Obesity "costs the NHS £4.2 billion annually". This year the Government started a "£375 million campaign" aimed at preventing people from becoming overweight by encouraging them to eat better and exercise more.
	- An "NHS Information Centre spokeswoman" who worked on the report, which was published yesterday, said that "diabetes" was dominating the primary care "drug bill" as better monitoring identified more sufferers and widely used medications for other conditions such as statins became cheaper. She said that the data suggested a growing use of "injectable insulin in type 2 diabetes care", which was helping to push up "costs".
	- Doctors agreed that more expensive "long-acting insulin", which can "cost about £30 per item", was being used more often, as well as more "expensive pills" and other agents.
	- The report, an update of the centre's "June" publication "Prescribing for Diabetes in England", shows that the number of "insulin items" prescribed "last year" rose by "300,000 to 5.5 million", at a "total cost of £288.3 million". It marked an "8 per cent rise on the £267 million spent in the previous year". However, while the number of "anti-diabetic drugs", which are mostly in tablet form, also rose, the "cost" dropped slightly to "£168.1 million".
	- '"Type" 2 is increasing. We are seeing it in younger people, and because it is a progressive disease, people are needing an increasing number of interventions as time goes by, the spokeswoman said, adding that "long-acting insulins" such as "Glargine" were now common. 'For people who are struggling to control their "type 2 diabetes" it makes sense, but it is quite a big clinical change "from five or ten years ago".
	- Other "anti-diabetic items", such as use of the subcutaneous "injection exenatide", have also increased and "cost £14.3 million". "Laurence Buckman", chairman of the "British Medical Association"'s general practice committee, said that he had observed a trend with drugs such as "exenatide", which "costs £80 per item". He said that younger patients could start on cheaper tablets such as "metformin", which "costs £3.70 per box", but were needing increasingly sophisticated treatments to keep their condition in check.
	- 'You are talking about an ever larger number of people getting a large range of drugs to reduce long-term complications. "Type 2" is a common chronic illness that is getting commoner. It's in everyone's interest to treat people early and with the most "effective drugs", and these are the more expensive tablets and "long-acting insulins",' he said.

## UNIT 6

### Part 2

#### Exercise 1

Requirement: Skim-read the passage and find the sections that refer to:
1. size, weight or other physical properties of brains
2. intelligence

Passage:
- Dolphins have been declared the world's second most intelligent creatures after humans, with scientists suggesting they are so bright that they should be treated as 'non-human persons'.
- Studies into dolphin behaviour have highlighted how similar their communications are to those of humans and that they are brighter than chimpanzees. These have been backed up by anatomical research showing that dolphin brains have many key features associated with high intelligence. The researchers argue that their work shows it is morally unacceptable to keep such intelligent animals in amusement parks or to kill them for food or by accident when fishing. Some 300,000 whales, dolphins and porpoises die in this way each year.
- 'Many dolphin brains are larger than our own and second in mass only to the human brain when corrected for body size,' said Lori Marino, a zoologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, who has used magnetic resonance imaging scans to map the brains of dolphin species and compare them with those of primates. 'The neuroanatomy suggests psychological continuity between humans and dolphins and has profound implications for the ethics of human-dolphin interactions,' she added.
- Dolphins have long been recognised as among the most intelligent of animals. Recently, a series of behavioural studies has suggested that dolphins, especially species such as the bottlenose, whose brains weigh about 5lb, could even be brighter than chimps, which some studies have found can reach the intelligence levels of three-year-old children. The studies show how dolphins have distinct personalities, a strong sense of self and can think about the future.
- It has also become clear that they are 'cultural' animals, meaning that new types of behaviour can quickly be picked up by one dolphin from another. In one study, Diana Reiss, professor of psychology at Hunter College, City University of New York, showed that bottlenose dolphins could recognise themselves in a mirror and use it to inspect various parts of their bodies, an ability that had been thought limited to humans and great apes. In another, she found that captive animals also had the ability to learn a rudimentary symbol-based language.
- Other research has shown dolphins can solve difficult problems, while those living in the wild co-operate in ways that imply complex social structures and a high level of emotional sophistication. In one recent case, a dolphin rescued from the wild was taught to tail-walk while recuperating for three weeks in a dolphinarium in Australia. After she was released, scientists were astonished to see the trick spreading among wild dolphins who had learnt it from the former captive. There are many similar examples, such as the way dolphins living off Western Australia learnt to hold sponges over their snouts to protect themselves when searching for spiny fish on the ocean floor. Such observations, along with others showing, for example, how dolphins could co-operate with military precision to round up shoals of fish to eat, have prompted questions about the brain structures that must underlie them.
- Size is only one factor. Researchers have found that brain size varies hugely from around 7oz for smaller cetacean species such as the Ganges River dolphin to more than 19lb for sperm whales, whose brains are the largest on the planet. Human brains, by contrast, range from 2lb-4lb, while a chimp's brain is about 12oz. When it comes to intelligence, however, brain size is less important than its size relative to the body. What Marino and her colleagues found was that the cerebral cortex and neocortex of bottlenose dolphins were so large that 'the anatomical ratios that assess cognitive capacity place it second only to the human brain'. They also found that the brain cortex of dolphins such as the bottlenose had the same convoluted folds that are strongly linked with human intelligence. Such folds increase the volume of the cortex and the ability of brain cells to interconnect with each other. 'Despite evolving along a different neuroanatomical trajectory to humans, cetacean brains have several features that are correlated with complex intelligence', Marino said.
- 'Marino and Reiss will present their findings at a conference in San Diego, California, next month, concluding that the new evidence about dolphin intelligence makes it morally repugnant to mistreat them. Thomas White, professor of ethics at Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, who has written a series of academic studies suggesting dolphins should have rights, will speak at the same conference. 'The scientific research... suggests that dolphins are "non-human persons" who qualify for moral standing as individuals,' he said.

- 'Marino and Reiss will present their findings at a conference in San Diego, California, next month, concluding that the new evidence about dolphin intelligence makes it morally repugnant to mistreat them. Thomas White, professor of ethics at Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, who has written a series of academic studies suggesting dolphins should have rights, will speak at the same conference. 'The scientific research... suggests that dolphins are "non-human persons" who qualify for moral standing as individuals,' he said.

Passage:

- It is 50 years since Jane Goodall first dipped her toes in the waters of Lake Tanganyika, in what is now the Gombe National Park in Tanzania. Since then she has been responsible for the most comprehensive study of wild chimpanzees - and become an idol of contemporary women scientists around the world.
- In 1962, at a time when no woman in the world held a PhD in primatology, Goodall started a PhD in ethology - the scientific study of animal behaviour - at the University of Cambridge. Her resulting thesis, Nest Building Behaviour in the Fre0hopjse Ranging Chimpanzee, included the observations that chimps use tools and eat meat. Goodall had redefined our understanding of the origins of Man. Louis Leakey, the famous palaeontologist and Goodall's mentor, said of her work: 'Now we must redefine "tool", redefine "Man", or accept chimpanzees as humans. Goodall's work, and that of two other female pioneers in primatology, Dian Fossey and Biruté Galdikas, was made possible by the example of Leakey. Born to British missionaries in Kenya in 1903, he was the first white baby the Kikuyu people had seen and he spoke their language before he learnt English. He grew up to be an ardent palaeontologist, archaeologist and anthropologist at the University of Cambridge and, later, with his wife Mary Douglas Nicol. Leakey thought that the attributes that made a good field scientist were innate to women.
- Because women were pre-programmed to be mothers, he thought, they had three crucial traits: they were patient, they were better able to understand an animal's desires by observing social non-verbal cues and they were less aggressive than men all beliefs later echoed by Goodall. He also felt that men were more concerned with conquering nature than committing themselves to detailed field studies.
- Goodall's career began in the late 1950s, when she worked as secretary to Leakey at the Coryndon Museum in Nairobi, of which he was the director. In 1960, after the 26-year-old Goodall had assisted on a fossil dig at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, she was sent by her mentor to study chimpanzees in the wild. At the insistence of the British Government she arrived in Gombe with her mother, Vanne, in tow. Spending day after day among the primates, she became fascinated by their behaviour and began informal studies. But at the insistence of Leakey, who warned that she would need to formalise her work to gain scientific credibility, she applied for a place at Cambridge.
- Since then Goodall and her two sisters in science, Fossey and Galdikas, have paved the way in primatology, a field that is now dominated by women. Gombe is one of the longest running research studies of wild animals anywhere in the world: it has produced 35 PhD theses, more than 30 books and 200 research papers and nine films. Furthermore, according to Julie Des Jardins, the author of The Madame Curie Complex: the Hidden History of Women in Science, 78 per cent of all PhDs awarded in primatology in 2000 were awarded to women. Goodall, Fossey and Galdikas have helped to inspire generations of women to pick up their binoculars and take to the world's fields and forests.
- Goodall comes from a dynasty of strong women and describes her mother and grandmother as 'those two amazing, strong women, undaunted'. Goodall's mother did not laugh at her daughter when she said she was going to Africa. 'My mother used to say: "If you really want something and you work hard and never give up, you find a way",' Goodall says. "She was definitely the greatest inspiration that I had.'
- If only science's old guard had had the same attitude. Today's scientific community was formalised by men. As a consequence of the scientific 'revolution' of the 17th and 18th centuries, science moved from the home to laboratories, universities and hospitals, establishments to which women were denied access, irrespective of their aptitude or contribution. In most fields of scientific research, most of the big players continue to be men. According to the UKRC (the body responsible for advancing gender equality in science, engineering and technology), in the 2007-08 academic year, in STEM - science, technology, engineering and maths - subjects, about one third of researchers were women. But in the higher reaches of the academic world, the numbers fall away. About a quarter of lecturers and fewer than one in ten professors are female.
- Perhaps this under-representation of women in science has in part been caused by a lack of prominent role models. The women who flourished under the guidance of Leakey, however, provide ample proof that if women are given opportunities, they can surpass all expectation. They can tread their own path through the forest and conduct credible research with far-reaching and long-lasting implications.
- Jane Goodall still believes that her mother's words about working hard to achieve a goal have the power to inspire young women who dream of becoming scientists. 'I would say to them what Mum said to me,' she says. Clearly, it works.

Passage:
- Holidaymakers faced disruption yesterday because of new plumes of ash from an Icelandic volcano, which forced the closure of airports in Spain and Portugal.
- The cancellations - which mainly affected Ryanair and easyJet services operating out of Stansted and Gatwick - came as scientists produced the first internal map of Eyjafjallajokull's network of magma chambers, which extend 12 miles below the ground.
- A new ash cloud has risen 30,000ft into the air and drifted south after a pulse of meltwater and ice poured into the Eyjafjallajokull volcano last week. The water caused huge explosions as it hit the hot lava, generating more ash plumes. European aviation regulators have imposed a maximum safe limit of 0.002 grammes of ash per cubic metre of air, meaning that if levels rise above this, flights cannot enter that airspace.
- The map shows how the volcano's tubes plunge deep down through the earth's crust to the start of the mantle, which is made of semi-molten rock. It reveals the huge scale of the eruption and the potential for a far greater one. This is because the magma chamber of Eyjafjallajokull is dwarfed by the much larger one under Katla, a volcano 15 miles to the east. Two of Katla's eruptions, in 1612 and 1821, are thought to have been triggered by those of its neighbour. While Katla is not part of the same underground network of magma channels and chambers, it is close enough to be affected by changes in pressure in Eyjafjallajokull's system. There is also a chance that a horizontal sheet of magma, known as a dike, beneath Eyjafjallajokull could stretch out far enough to penetrate a magma chamber beneath Katla. Hitting the roots of its neighbour would almost certainly trigger an eruption. The three eruptions of Eyjafjallajokull on record have each been associated with a subsequent eruption of Katla. There have, so far, been no signs of turbulence beneath Katla's surface but, having last erupted in 1918, vulcanologists say that a new blast is overdue.
- The workings of the volcanoes have been provisionally drawn up by Professor Erik Sturkell, a geologist at the Nordic Volcanological Centre, University of Iceland. Sturkell suggests the Eyjafjallajokull eruption has been building since 1994, when new lava began rising, forming two reservoirs three miles beneath the volcano. A surge of earthquakes under Katla mean it has experienced a similar influx of lava, Sturkell said. 'This suggests the volcano is close to eruption.'

### Passage

- The Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the mid-1700s and by the 1830s and 1840s had spread to many other parts of the world, including the United States. In Britain, it was a period when a largely rural, agrarian* society was transformed into an industrialised, urban one. Goods that had once been crafted by hand started to be produced in mass quantities by machines in factories, thanks to the invention of steam power and the introduction of new machines and manufacturing techniques in textiles, iron-making and other industries.
- The foundations of the Industrial Revolution date back to the early 1700s, when the English inventor Thomas Newcomen designed the first modern steam engine. Called the 'atmospheric steam engine', Newcomen's invention was originally used to power machines that pumped water out of mines. In the 1760s, the Scottish engineer James Watt started to adapt one of Newcomen's models, and succeeded in making it far more efficient. Watt later worked with the English manufacturer Matthew Boulton to invent a new steam engine driven by both the forward and backward strokes of the piston, while the gear mechanism it was connected to produced rotary motion. It was a key innovation that would allow steam power to spread across British industries.
- The demand for coal, which was a relatively cheap energy source, grew rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, as it was needed to run not only the factories used to produce manufactured goods, but also steam-powered transportation. In the early 1800s, the English engineer Richard Trevithick built a steam-powered locomotive, and by 1830 goods and passengers were being transported between the industrial centres of Manchester and Liverpool. In addition, steam-powered boats and ships were widely used to carry goods along Britain's canals as well as across the Atlantic.
- Britain had produced textiles like wool, linen and cotton, for hundreds of years, but prior to the Industrial Revolution, the British textile business was a true 'cottage industry', with the work performed in small workshops or even homes by individual spinners, weavers and dyers. Starting in the mid-1700s, innovations like the spinning jenny and the power loom made weaving cloth and spinning yarn and thread much easier. With these machines, relatively little labour was required to produce cloth, and the new, mechanised textile factories that opened around the country were quickly able to meet customer demand for cloth both at home and abroad.
- The British iron industry also underwent major change as it adopted new innovations. Chief among the new techniques was the smelting of iron ore with coke (a material made by heating coal) instead of the traditional charcoal. This method was cheaper and produced metals that were of a higher quality, enabling Britain's iron and steel production to expand in response to demand created by the Napoleonic Wars (1803-15) and the expansion of the railways from the 1830s.
- The latter part of the Industrial Revolution also saw key advances in communication methods, as people increasingly saw the need to communicate efficiently over long distances. In 1837, British inventors William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone patented the first commercial telegraphy system. In the 1830s and 1840s, Samuel Morse and other inventors worked on their own versions in the United States. Cooke and Wheatstone's system was soon used for railway signalling in the UK. As the speed of the new locomotives increased, it was essential to have a fast and effective means of avoiding collisions.
- The impact of the Industrial Revolution on people's lives was immense. Although many people in Britain had begun moving to the cities from rural areas before the Industrial Revolution, this accelerated dramatically with industrialisation, as the rise of large factories turned smaller towns into major cities in just a few decades. This rapid urbanisation brought significant challenges, as overcrowded cities suffered from pollution and inadequate sanitation.
- Although industrialisation increased the country's economic output overall and improved the standard of living for the middle and upper classes, many poor people continued to struggle. Factory workers had to work long hours in dangerous conditions for extremely low wages. These conditions along with the rapid pace of change fuelled opposition to industrialisation. A group of British workers who became known as 'Luddites' were British weavers and textile workers who objected to the increased use of mechanised looms and knitting frames. Many had spent years learning their craft, and they feared that unskilled machine operators were robbing them of their livelihood. A few desperate weavers began breaking into factories and smashing textile machines. They called themselves Luddites after Ned Ludd, a young apprentice who was rumoured to have wrecked a textile machine in 1779.
- The first major instances of machine breaking took place in 1811 in the city of Nottingham, and the practice soon spread across the country. Machine-breaking Luddites attacked and burned factories, and in some cases they even exchanged gunfire with company guards and soldiers. The workers wanted employers to stop installing new machinery, but the British government responded to the uprisings by making machine-breaking punishable by death. The unrest finally reached its peak in April 1812, when a few Luddites were shot during an attack on a mill near Huddersfield. In the days that followed, other Luddites were arrested, and dozens were hanged or transported to Australia. By 1813, the Luddite resistance had all but vanished.

This method was cheaper and "produced metals" that were of a higher quality, enabling "Britain"'s "iron" and steel production to expand in response to demand created by the "Napoleonic Wars (1803-15)" and the "expansion" of the railways from the "1830s".
- (10) The latter part of the Industrial Revolution also saw key advances in "communication" methods, as people increasingly saw the need to communicate efficiently over long distances. In "1837", British inventors "William Cooke" and "Charles Wheatstone" patented the first commercial telegraphy system. In the "1830s" and "1840s", "Samuel Morse" and other inventors worked on their own versions in the United States. "Cooke and Wheatstone"'s system was soon used for railway signalling in the UK. As the speed of the new locomotives increased, it was essential to have a fast and effective means of avoiding collisions.
- (7/11) The impact of the Industrial Revolution on people's lives was immense. Although many people in Britain had begun moving to the cities from rural areas before the Industrial Revolution, this accelerated dramatically with "industrialisation", as the rise of large factories turned smaller towns into major cities in just a few decades. This rapid "urbanisation" brought significant challenges, as overcrowded "cities" suffered from pollution and inadequate sanitation.
- (11/12) Although "industrialisation" increased the country's economic output overall and improved the standard of living for the middle and upper classes, many poor people continued to struggle. Factory workers had to work long hours in dangerous conditions for extremely low wages. These conditions along with the rapid pace of change fuelled opposition to "industrialisation". A group of British workers who became known as '"Luddites"' were British "weavers" and textile workers who objected to the increased use of mechanised looms and knitting frames. Many had spent years learning their craft, and they feared that unskilled machine operators were robbing them of their livelihood. A few desperate "weavers" began breaking into factories and smashing textile machines. They called themselves "Luddites" after "Ned Ludd", a young apprentice who was rumoured to have wrecked a textile machine in "1779".
- (13) The first major instances of machine breaking took place in "1811" in the "city" of Nottingham, and the practice soon spread across the country. Machine-breaking "Luddites" attacked and burned factories, and in some cases they even exchanged gunfire with company guards and soldiers. The workers wanted employers to stop installing new machinery, but the British government responded to the uprisings by making machine-breaking punishable by death. The unrest finally reached its peak in April 1812, when a few "Luddites" were shot during an attack on a mill near "Huddersfield". In the days that followed, other "Luddites" were arrested, and dozens were hanged or transported to "Australia". By "1813", the "Luddite" resistance had all but vanished.

1. "Watt" later worked with the "English" manufacturer "Matthew Boulton" to invent a new "steam engine" driven by both the forward and backward strokes of the piston, while the "gear" mechanism it was connected to produced rotary motion. => Piston
2. The demand for coal, which was a relatively cheap energy source, grew rapidly during the "Industrial Revolution", as it was needed to run not only the factories used to produce manufactured "goods", but also steam-powered "transportation" => Coal
3. but prior to the "Industrial Revolution", the British "textile" business was a true '"cottage industry"', with the work performed in small workshops or even homes by individual "spinners", "weavers" and dyers. => Workshops
4. With these machines, relatively little labour was required to produce cloth, and the new, mechanised "textile" factories that opened around the country were quickly able to meet customer demand for cloth both at home and abroad. => Labour
5. Chief among the new techniques was the "smelting" of "iron" ore with "coke" (a material made by heating coal) instead of the traditional charcoal. This method was cheaper and produced metals that were of a higher quality => Quality

Bicycle

- I learned how to ride a bike when I was very young but I never really knew much about what each part of the bike was called. As I began to ask questions about bikes, I realized I had no clue what the experts were saying. It was like a foreign language to me. So like any foreign language you have to start with the basics.
- The most known part of a bicycle, a bicycle saddle, often *called* a *seat*, is one of three contact points on an upright bicycle. It’s a place where you seat while riding a bike. A bicycle *saddle* is commonly *attached* to the bicycle frame, the main component of a bicycle, onto which *wheels* and other components are fitted. Cyclist often attach a *bottle of water* to the *underneath* part of the frame, called a down tube.
- The second contact point of the bicycle is a pedal, the part of your bicycle that you *push* with your *foot* to propel the bicycle. The *pedal* provides the connection between the cyclist's *foot* or *shoe* and the crankarm. The *crankarm* turns the chain and propels the bicycle's *wheel*. The dark round detail in the centre of the *back wheel* is called cogset, it is used as speed transmission mechanism.
- The last contact point of the bicycle is bicycle handlebar, the steering mechanism for bicycles. You *put* your *hands* on the bicycle handlebar and *drive* your bike by *turning* it to different sides. The *handlebars* are *attached* to the stem, which *goes down* and connects with a *fork*. The fork is a thin metal rod, which *fore wheel* is attached to.

### Passage:

- Due to the growing need for linguistic diversity in further education establishments and workplaces, an early introduction to foreign language learning is implemented in primary schools in the European Union (EU). At present there are 24 officially recognised languages within the EU. The number of official languages in the EU has always been lower than that of its Member States, as some EU Member States share common languages. For instance, the official languages of Belgium are Dutch, French and German. In addition to the official languages, there are indigenous regional and minority languages spoken in some EU Member States, such as Catalan, Galician and Basque in Spain. Many other languages have been brought to the EU by migrant populations, including Arabic, Chinese and Turkish.
- Within primary education, a very high proportion of pupils learn English in a majority of EU Member States. Learning English is mandatory within secondary education institutions in several Member States, and therefore a number of them have close to 100 % of pupils learning this language already in primary education. The countries of Cyprus and Malta, for instance, have reached 100% in 2019, and Spain 99%. In Greece and in France, at least 9 out of 10 primary schools taught English as a foreign language.
- Many of the eastern and northern European Member States that joined the EU in 2004 or 2007 were previously required to learn Russian. This situation has changed rapidly and in most of these countries there has been a marked increase in the proportion of pupils learning English. For instance, by 2019, 80% of Slovenian Primary schools taught English.
- Luxembourg is an interesting case, as it has three official languages, with most pupils receiving instruction in Luxembourgish, German and French in primary education, and where English is only introduced at secondary school. Luxembourg has the highest percentage (84%) of primary schools teaching French. Less than 20% of Spanish and Greek primary schools have introduced the language, and less than 5% did in Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia.
- In 2019, German was the principal foreign language taught to all primary school children in Luxembourg (100 %). Less than 20% of primary schools in Greece taught the language, and less than 5% did in Cyprus, Malta, Spain, France and Slovenia.
