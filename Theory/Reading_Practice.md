Exam tip: When you come across a word you don't know in a text, look at the context. It will often express the sam e idea in other words or give clues as to the meaning.

Exam information: Completion tasks (1)
Completion tasks test your ability to find and understand detailed or specific information in a text.

Completing a table, diagram, or picture: You will have to read a passage and complete a table, diagram, or picture. The information in the passage will not necessarily be in the same order as the questions. The table, diagram, or picture may relate to a section of the passage rather than the whole. You will be told how many words you should use (e.g. no more than two words, one word only, no more than two words and a number). Numbers can be written in numbers (e.g. 5) or words (e.g. five). Hyphenated words count as one word (e.g. state-of-the-art counts as one word).

Exam tip: When you are looking for specific information (e.g. places, names, phrases), move your eyes down the text, looking only for words and phrases related to the information you want. Do not read word for word, do not stop if there are words you do not know, and ignore any information you do not need. This technique is called scanning'. You can also use the text style or formatting to help you. Sometimes, numbers, uppercase letters, italics, bold print, quotation marks and other visual information within a text can help you locate the information you want.

Exam tips:
- When you do a completion task, read the instructions carefully and note how many words you are allowed to write. Sometimes you will have to summarise the information in order to keep within the word limit.
- Charts or diagrams give a summary of the information and show visual links, so think about the relationship between the ideas in a text. The different parts of a chart/diagram may not be in the same order as the information in the text. The chart/diagram may not show all the information included in the text.
- The answers in a particular section of the chart/diagram must belong to the same grammatical category, e.g. they should all be nouns, or all verbs.
- The chart/diagram may not use the same words as the text but synonyms or paraphrases.
