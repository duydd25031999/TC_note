2. Scanning những từ liên quan tới câu hỏi: Bước 1 chỉ là brainstorming ban đầu, dựa vào đó để scanning
	- In all societies there are groups of people who are potentially vulnerable. These include children, older people, people with disabilities, and the poor, for example. Whether they are supported and how they are supported, however, varies from society to society and at different times in history.
	- In some societies, the "care" of the vulnerable is seen as the "responsibility" of the "family" or the "village". In others, it is principally the "responsibility" of the "state", through "community provision". In "Israeli kibbutzim", for example, the "care" of children is seen as the "responsibility" of the whole "community", and not principally the concern of the birth parents. In other societies the "care" of children is the prime "responsibility" of their "parents", and in some it is the "responsibility" of the "extended family". Attitudes to the vulnerable vary. Those on benefits may be seen as 'lazy scroungers', or their situation may be seen as the result of poor parenting or the inevitable consequence of economic changes. The response to their need will vary according to the dominant attitudes in the society, the views and priorities of government, the wealth of the "nation", and how that wealth is distributed and managed.
	- In England, the state has had some involvement in providing for the poor since Elizabethan times. The "1601 Poor Law" allowed "officials" to collect money from each household in their parish and to distribute it to the needy. However, it was thought that the poor only had themselves to blame. The "political approach" at the time was informed by a view that the "government" should not interfere in the workings of the economy or in the provision of welfare services. The "church" and other "voluntary groups" provided "charitable support", but the state 'left well alone'. Not until the opening years of the twentieth century did the "state" begin to take a proactive role in the "care" and welfare of its "citizens".

	- So far in this chapter, we have questioned common-sense ideas held about what is sickness and health and have raised some challenging questions about these ideas. However, we can go further and question a closely related concept upon which notions of "illness" are ultimately based: the concept of "the body".
	- All of us exist in "bodies" that are "objectively" different shapes, heights, "colours" and physical "abilities"; they are also "subjectively" valued as attractive or ugly, young or old, short or tall, weak or strong.
	- Let us look first at the "objective differences". The "two" most common explanations for "objective" differences between "bodies" are, first, that people's "bodies" vary according to genetic differences (height, weight, etc.) and, second, that "bodies" change as people age. However "sociologists" point out that the shapes of people's "bodies" are often actually linked to diets, "type of employment" and general quality of life. A huge range of research indicates that poorer people are more likely to:
		- eat 'unhealthy' foods and to smoke cigarettes
		- be employed in repetitive, physically demanding work or the other extreme of boring, sedentary employment
		- have worse housing conditions
		- live in more deprived neighbourhoods
	- All of these factors impact upon the condition of a person's "body" and health. We can see then that the physical shapes of "bodies" are strongly influenced by social factors.

	- The rising problem of obesity has helped to make "diabetes treatments" the biggest drug bill in primary care, with almost "£600 million of medicines" prescribed by doctors "last year", according to the "NHS Information Centre".
	- Analysts said that young people contracting the condition, which is often associated with obesity, were helping to push up "costs" as doctors tried to improve their long-term control of the disease and prevent complications.
	- A "total of 32.9 million diabetes drugs, costing £599.3 million", were prescribed in the "past financial year". In "2004-05" there were "24.8 million, costing £458 million". More than "90 per cent of the 2.4 million diabetics in England" have "type 2 diabetes", with the remainder suffering from "type 1", the "insulin-dependent form of the disease". There are thought to be "500,000 undiagnosed cases of diabetes".
	- While "rates of type 1" have shown slight increases in "recent years", "type 2" has risen far more rapidly - a trend linked to the increasing number of people who are overweight or obese. Almost "one in four adults in England" is obese, with predictions that "nine in ten" will be overweight or obese "by 2050". Obesity "costs the NHS £4.2 billion annually". This year the Government started a "£375 million campaign" aimed at preventing people from becoming overweight by encouraging them to eat better and exercise more.
	- An "NHS Information Centre spokeswoman" who worked on the report, which was published yesterday, said that "diabetes" was dominating the primary care "drug bill" as better monitoring identified more sufferers and widely used medications for other conditions such as statins became cheaper. She said that the data suggested a growing use of "injectable insulin in type 2 diabetes care", which was helping to push up "costs".
	- Doctors agreed that more expensive "long-acting insulin", which can "cost about £30 per item", was being used more often, as well as more "expensive pills" and other agents.
	- The report, an update of the centre's "June" publication "Prescribing for Diabetes in England", shows that the number of "insulin items" prescribed "last year" rose by "300,000 to 5.5 million", at a "total cost of £288.3 million". It marked an "8 per cent rise on the £267 million spent in the previous year". However, while the number of "anti-diabetic drugs", which are mostly in tablet form, also rose, the "cost" dropped slightly to "£168.1 million".
	- '"Type" 2 is increasing. We are seeing it in younger people, and because it is a progressive disease, people are needing an increasing number of interventions as time goes by, the spokeswoman said, adding that "long-acting insulins" such as "Glargine" were now common. 'For people who are struggling to control their "type 2 diabetes" it makes sense, but it is quite a big clinical change "from five or ten years ago".
	- Other "anti-diabetic items", such as use of the subcutaneous "injection exenatide", have also increased and "cost £14.3 million". "Laurence Buckman", chairman of the "British Medical Association"'s general practice committee, said that he had observed a trend with drugs such as "exenatide", which "costs £80 per item". He said that younger patients could start on cheaper tablets such as "metformin", which "costs £3.70 per box", but were needing increasingly sophisticated treatments to keep their condition in check.
	- 'You are talking about an ever larger number of people getting a large range of drugs to reduce long-term complications. "Type 2" is a common chronic illness that is getting commoner. It's in everyone's interest to treat people early and with the most "effective drugs", and these are the more expensive tablets and "long-acting insulins",' he said.

## Test 2

### Passage 1

#### Original

- The Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the mid-1700s and by the 1830s and 1840s had spread to many other parts of the world, including the United States. In Britain, it was a period when a largely rural, agrarian* society was transformed into an industrialised, urban one. Goods that had once been crafted by hand started to be produced in mass quantities by machines in factories, thanks to the invention of steam power and the introduction of new machines and manufacturing techniques in textiles, iron-making and other industries.
- The foundations of the Industrial Revolution date back to the early 1700s, when the English inventor Thomas Newcomen designed the first modern steam engine. Called the 'atmospheric steam engine', Newcomen's invention was originally used to power machines that pumped water out of mines. In the 1760s, the Scottish engineer James Watt started to adapt one of Newcomen's models, and succeeded in making it far more efficient. Watt later worked with the English manufacturer Matthew Boulton to invent a new steam engine driven by both the forward and backward strokes of the piston, while the gear mechanism it was connected to produced rotary motion. It was a key innovation that would allow steam power to spread across British industries.
- The demand for coal, which was a relatively cheap energy source, grew rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, as it was needed to run not only the factories used to produce manufactured goods, but also steam-powered transportation. In the early 1800s, the English engineer Richard Trevithick built a steam-powered locomotive, and by 1830 goods and passengers were being transported between the industrial centres of Manchester and Liverpool. In addition, steam-powered boats and ships were widely used to carry goods along Britain's canals as well as across the Atlantic.
- Britain had produced textiles like wool, linen and cotton, for hundreds of years, but prior to the Industrial Revolution, the British textile business was a true 'cottage industry', with the work performed in small workshops or even homes by individual spinners, weavers and dyers. Starting in the mid-1700s, innovations like the spinning jenny and the power loom made weaving cloth and spinning yarn and thread much easier. With these machines, relatively little labour was required to produce cloth, and the new, mechanised textile factories that opened around the country were quickly able to meet customer demand for cloth both at home and abroad.
- The British iron industry also underwent major change as it adopted new innovations. Chief among the new techniques was the smelting of iron ore with coke (a material made by heating coal) instead of the traditional charcoal. This method was cheaper and produced metals that were of a higher quality, enabling Britain's iron and steel production to expand in response to demand created by the Napoleonic Wars (1803-15) and the expansion of the railways from the 1830s.
- The latter part of the Industrial Revolution also saw key advances in communication methods, as people increasingly saw the need to communicate efficiently over long distances. In 1837, British inventors William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone patented the first commercial telegraphy system. In the 1830s and 1840s, Samuel Morse and other inventors worked on their own versions in the United States. Cooke and Wheatstone's system was soon used for railway signalling in the UK. As the speed of the new locomotives increased, it was essential to have a fast and effective means of avoiding collisions.
- The impact of the Industrial Revolution on people's lives was immense. Although many people in Britain had begun moving to the cities from rural areas before the Industrial Revolution, this accelerated dramatically with industrialisation, as the rise of large factories turned smaller towns into major cities in just a few decades. This rapid urbanisation brought significant challenges, as overcrowded cities suffered from pollution and inadequate sanitation.
- Although industrialisation increased the country's economic output overall and improved the standard of living for the middle and upper classes, many poor people continued to struggle. Factory workers had to work long hours in dangerous conditions for extremely low wages. These conditions along with the rapid pace of change fuelled opposition to industrialisation. A group of British workers who became known as 'Luddites' were British weavers and textile workers who objected to the increased use of mechanised looms and knitting frames. Many had spent years learning their craft, and they feared that unskilled machine operators were robbing them of their livelihood. A few desperate weavers began breaking into factories and smashing textile machines. They called themselves Luddites after Ned Ludd, a young apprentice who was rumoured to have wrecked a textile machine in 1779.
- The first major instances of machine breaking took place in 1811 in the city of Nottingham, and the practice soon spread across the country. Machine-breaking Luddites attacked and burned factories, and in some cases they even exchanged gunfire with company guards and soldiers. The workers wanted employers to stop installing new machinery, but the British government responded to the uprisings by making machine-breaking punishable by death. The unrest finally reached its peak in April 1812, when a few Luddites were shot during an attack on a mill near Huddersfield. In the days that followed, other Luddites were arrested, and dozens were hanged or transported to Australia. By 1813, the Luddite resistance had all but vanished.

In the days that followed, other "Luddites" were arrested, and dozens were hanged or transported to "Australia". By "1813", the "Luddite" resistance had all but vanished.

1. "Watt" later worked with the "English" manufacturer "Matthew Boulton" to invent a new "steam engine" driven by both the forward and backward strokes of the piston, while the "gear" mechanism it was connected to produced rotary motion. => Piston
2. The demand for coal, which was a relatively cheap energy source, grew rapidly during the "Industrial Revolution", as it was needed to run not only the factories used to produce manufactured "goods", but also steam-powered "transportation" => Coal
3. but prior to the "Industrial Revolution", the British "textile" business was a true '"cottage industry"', with the work performed in small workshops or even homes by individual "spinners", "weavers" and dyers. => Workshops
4. With these machines, relatively little labour was required to produce cloth, and the new, mechanised "textile" factories that opened around the country were quickly able to meet customer demand for cloth both at home and abroad. => Labour
5. Chief among the new techniques was the "smelting" of "iron" ore with "coke" (a material made by heating coal) instead of the traditional charcoal. This method was cheaper and produced metals that were of a higher quality => Quality
6. enabling "Britain"'s "iron" and steel production to expand in response to demand created by the "Napoleonic Wars (1803-15)" and the "expansion" of the railways from the "1830s". => Railways
7. This rapid "urbanisation" brought significant challenges, as overcrowded "cities" suffered from pollution and inadequate sanitation. => Sanitation
8. In addition, "steam"-powered boats and ships were widely used to carry "goods" along "Britain's canals" as well as across the Atlantic. => Not Given
9. This method was cheaper and produced metals that were of a higher quality => False
10. In "1837", British inventors "William Cooke" and "Charles Wheatstone" patented the first commercial telegraphy system. In the "1830s" and "1840s", "Samuel Morse" and other inventors worked on their own versions in the United States. => Not Given
11. Although "industrialisation" increased the country's economic output overall and improved the standard of living for the middle and upper classes, many poor people continued to struggle. => True
12. Many had spent years learning their craft, and they feared that unskilled machine operators were robbing them of their livelihood. => True
13. The unrest finally reached its peak in April 1812, when a few "Luddites" were shot during an attack on a mill near "Huddersfield". In the days that followed, other "Luddites" were arrested, and dozens were hanged or transported to "Australia". => Not Given
