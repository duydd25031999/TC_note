# What is System Design

## Large scale distributed systems

### Large scale

- Use a lot or intensive in terms of computer or data or any computer engineering principle
1. Have a lot of data
1. Used by a lot of people
1. Updated frequently
1. A lot of performance expectations

### Distributed systems

- The server or the code that is actually executing this program is not in one place.

## Design patterns

- A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design
- Design patterns are particular practices, principles, or processes which are used by engineers to build these systems.
- Design patterns are common solutions for common problems

## System Design

1. Define requirements from the user's perspective.
    - Well document
    - Business banked document
    - Most important feature
2. Reduce these features to data definitions.
    1. Product requirement doc
    2. Features/ abstract concepts
    3. Data definitions
    4. Object
    5. Database
3. Endpoint
        - API

## Fault Tolerance

- Usually a product requirement document does not define optional or good to have features. 
- These are all core features which are required in the document.
- The good to have features will be probably picked up in the next document
    - Don't need to think of which features are optional

## Extensibility

- How easy it is to change that solution.
- Build a system that can Scale & Extend as and when requirement change

## Testing

- Design should be tested
