- The main goal is to have a smooth flow of work from start to completion without any stoppage or bottlenecks.
- The team must define what that flow of work entails.
    - How does a particular work item go from start to completion?
    - What are the various steps or stages that it would go through?
    - What is involved with transitioning the work items through each stage and ultimately getting it to a done state?
- Kanban teams can also set a limit on the number of work items in each column of the board.

- The most of these things, most of the time are difficult to estimate or predict.
- The best way to get them done would be to keep the highest priority tickets at the top of the blacklog
- Development team work on them one by one and get them to a done state
