# Scrum Elements

## Concept

<aside>
üí° Scrum is probably the most highly recognized agile methodology.

</aside>

- Break project to user functionality represented by epics and user stories
- Scrum s·ª≠ d·ª•ng quy tr√¨nh c·ªßa Agile
- Nh∆∞ng define task d·ª±a tr√™n user functionality th√¥ng qua epics & user stories

## Epic

- Larger body of work

<aside>
üí° Work that cannot be completed in a given iteration.

</aside>

- It usually gets broken into multiple user stories.

## User story

- A user story or just story is basically the smallest unit of work

<aside>
üí° Work should be completed a given iteration in advance.

</aside>

- Represent a feature that is to be developed.
- Stories are usually defined using a particular format by specifying the type of user involved what the user is trying to achieve and the benefit for achieving it.

> As a/an `type of user`, I want `some goal`, so that `some reason`
> 
> - As a `manager`, I would like to `learn about JIRA` so that `I can use it to manage project susing agile workflows`
- After defined ‚áí story is prioritized and continuously implemented and delivered in short cycles known as sprints.

# Scrum Flow

## 1. Product Backlog

- Contains all the features you want to build in the form of user stories.
- These features of stories get prioritized
    - Sorted by priority
    - The most important features are at the top of the backlog.

<aside>
‚ùó Features at the top of the backlog should be ready for development.

</aside>

- Important features are in a ready state with all requirements and details laid out.
- Product Backlog Item (PBIS) = User story

## 2. Sprint Backlog

- A group features are what the team will implement during this sprint.

## 3. Sprint

- A sprint is a predetermined length of time.
- Takes the tickets from the Sprint backlog and gets them to a done state by the end of the sprint.
- During the sprint, the team has a daily scrum meeting (15 minutes)
    - Discuss the progress of the sprint and make sure things are on track.

## 4. Release

- End of the sprint, the team should have a shoppable group of features that can then be reviewed by customers or relevant stakeholders.

# Scrum Roles

## Product Owner

- Basically owns the product

<aside>
üí° Defines the vision of the product

</aside>

- What should be built and why

‚áí Product owner define Product Backlog

- Creates the user stories, prioritizes them, and ensures they are groomed with all relevant details.

## Development Team

- Builds the product

## Scrum Master

- Facilitates the scrum process
- Make sure no blockers on anyone that would prevent the sprint goal from being achieved.

# Scrum Events

## Sprint Planning

- Create `sprint backlog` from `product backlog`
    - Select highest priority or fully groomed
- Dev team provides estimates - story points or hours

### Story point

- Story point estimation is basically done where estimates are made relative to the smallest component or item with the known level of difficulty.
- `Team Velocity`: how many story points team can complete in a sprint.
    - Use this metric to predict how many story points they're going to be able to fit in the next sprint.

## Daily Scrum

- What I did yesterday?
- What I plan to do today
- Do I have any blockers?

## Sprint Review & Retrospective

- Review - what was completed/not completed
- Retrospective - what went well during Spring and what could be improved for next Sprint

## Scrum Board

- Board to check status of features in Sprint Backlog
- A Scrum board is typically structured in the form of columns
- The goal of the sprint is to basically move all the tickets from the leftmost column to the right.
