# Introduction

- Hi, My name is Do Duc Duy, but you can call me Alex.
- I'm a front-end engineer with more than five years of experience in building web applications. 
- I love building clean UI, writting maintainable code and creating enjoyable apps for my customer. 
- Besides Front-end, I also have experience with some backend tools like NodeJS and PHP, MySQL and MongoDB. 
- My work covers domain like commerce, cloud management, CRM and AI assistant platforms. 
- I also take part in pre-sale activities. 
- I work directly with my customer to analyze their requirements, make technical plan and estimate timeline for the project. 
- I often discuss with my customer about the idea and risk to find the best scope for my product. 
- I lead a small front end team from three to five members. 
- My leadership style is simple, clear, clean communication and open speech. 
- For example, when we take a big features I will try to defind the first detail plan for our team.
- But before starting I and my team will brainstorm and discuss to find the best schedule for us to work effectively 
- And in my part department, besides front end developer roles, my responsibility also includes technical interviews improve code practices and mentoring junior members. 
- So that's a bit about me. Please feel free to ask any question about me or my latest project.

# Bespin
- My most recent project is Bespin, a web-based AI platform designed to help DevOps engineers manage Cloud resources using natural language. You think of it as a ChatGPT for the Cloud where users can control cloud services directly via chat
- I WAS THE TEAM LEADER. I PARTICIPATE IN THE TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS MANAGING MY TEAM.
- On the technical side, my biggest challenge was building a Real-time Web Terminal to control EC2 instances from the browser. We needed to synchronize data streams over unstable connections, and since no existing library met our requirements, I built the logic from scratch. This involved complex tasks like detecting command boundaries and splitting the output to feed both the UI and the AI Copilot Assistant.
- WHEN I TOOK THE leadership role, I joined the project right from the pre-sale phase. I analyzed the client's raw ideas to create high-level designs and WBS for estimation. I also coordinated my team to adapt to the startup’s fast-changing requirements.
- Luckily, the Web Terminal became a core feature, playing a key role in securing multiple funding rounds. The system successfully evolved through 4 phases, and I was proud to see our solution directly helping the product BECOME better.
