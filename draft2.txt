- Hi, My name is Do Duc Duy, but you can call me Alex.
- I'm a front-end engineer with more than five years of experience in building web applications. 
- I love building clean UI, writting maintainable code and creating enjoyable apps for my customer. 
- Besides Front-end, I also have experience with some backend tools like NodeJS and PHP, MySQL and MongoDB. 
- My work covers domain like commerce, cloud management, CRM and AI assistant platforms. 
- I also take part in pre-sale activities. 
- I work directly with my customer to analyze their requirements, make technical plan and estimate timeline for the project. 
- I often discuss with my customer about the idea and risk to find the best scope for my product. 
- I lead a small front end team from three to five members. 
- My leadership style is simple, clear, clean communication and open speech. 
- For example, when we take a big features I will try to defind the first detail plan for our team.
- But before starting I and my team will brainstorm and discuss to find the best schedule for us to work effectively 
- And in my part department, besides front end developer roles, my responsibility also includes technical interviews improve code practices and mentoring junior members. 
- So that's a bit about me. Please feel free to ask any question about me or my latest project.
