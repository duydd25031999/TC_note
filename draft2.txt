- Hello, my name is Do Duc Duy. You can just call me Duy.
- I’m a Front-end Developer with more than, 5 years of experience, in building, modern web applications.
- My main tools are ReactJS, VueJS, TypeScript, RESTful APIs, and Tailwind CSS.
- Sometimes I also play with back-end tools, like, NodeJS, LaravelPHP, MySQL, and MongoDB.
- I love building clean UI, writing maintainable code, and creating apps, that, users actually enjoy.
- My work covers domains like, E-commerce, Cloud management, CRM, and AI Assistant platforms.
- Besides coding, I often work directly with clients:
- I analyze requests, make technical plans, estimate timelines
- And when the ideas are too crazy, I would say “no”, politely
- I have experience leading small front-end teams (3 or 5 members), running code reviews, mentoring juniors
- And even joining presale activities, as a front-end advisor.
- I believe in smart teamwork: balancing between, discipline and flexibility.
- For example, I organize tasks clearly by my-self, but also, encourage other members, brainstorming and creativity.
- I’ve also, conducted technical interviews, and helped teams improve their coding practices.
- My leadership style is simple: clear goals, clean communication and open to speech.
- That’s a bit about me. If you want, I can introduce about my latest project
