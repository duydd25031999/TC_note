# 1\. Evaluation Ratings (Out of 10\)

* **English Fluency & Pronunciation:** **7/10** – The speaker’s fluency is decent, and he can articulate his thoughts without long pauses. However, there are noticeable pronunciation issues, especially dropping ending consonant sounds (e.g. saying “fi’” instead of **“five”**, “experien’” for **“experience”**) and mispronouncing some letters (like pronouncing “PHP” in Vietnamese instead of the English **“P-H-P”**). These slips affect clarity and are common for Vietnamese speakers learning English[\[1\]](https://www.wellsaidcoaching.com/blog/pronunciation-and-accent-clarity-for-vietnamese-speakers-of-english#:~:text=English%20www,Unvoiced%20Consonants%3A). With practice on enunciating final consonants and tricky words, his speech would be much clearer.

* **Interviewer Engagement:** **6/10** – The introduction covers a lot of ground but currently feels more like a list of facts than a story. While he includes an interesting project example (comparing an AI assistant to *“Jarvis for cloud”* was a nice touch), the delivery could be more engaging. The peer feedback noted that the intro **“mostly listed tasks”** without showcasing what makes him *truly stand out* – for instance, **why** his skills are valuable or any standout achievements. To increase engagement, he could emphasize a few key strengths with brief anecdotes or impressive results to pique the interviewer’s interest.

* **Technical/Scientific Content Depth:** **8/10** – For a self-introduction, he provides a solid amount of technical detail. He clearly identifies his core front-end tech stack (React, Vue, TypeScript, REST APIs, Tailwind CSS)[\[2\]](file://file-2GNUbiVFYbiM928LtNPaz9#:~:text=,MySQL%2C%20and%20MongoDB%20when%20needed) and even mentions back-end exposure. The highlight is his **Bespin project** example, where he describes building a real-time WebSocket terminal and integrating an AI Copilot – a fairly deep technical accomplishment for an intro. This shows he can handle complex technical challenges. There’s enough tech content to demonstrate expertise, without delving into excessive jargon. It’s a good balance for a first introduction, and it gives the interviewer concrete topics to follow up on.

* **Completeness (Coverage of Role, Skills & Context):** **9/10** – The introduction is very comprehensive. He introduces himself with his role and experience level, lists his primary technical skills, and notes domains he’s worked in (e-commerce, cloud management, CRM, AI platforms). He also mentions working directly with clients, planning and estimating, saying “no” to unrealistic ideas, leading small teams (3–5 members), doing code reviews, mentoring juniors, and even presale consulting. Finally, he discusses a recent project with his specific contributions and the outcome. This breadth **covers almost every relevant area** of his background – technical skills, soft skills, leadership, and a project success. It’s an almost complete picture for a brief intro[\[3\]](file://file-2GNUbiVFYbiM928LtNPaz9#:~:text=,end%20strategy)[\[4\]](file://file-8zNNjSDmUJ8Yn3MdqiUoKH#:~:text=,product%20alignment%20with%20customer%20needs). The only reason it’s not 10 is that he might slightly overload the listener; a few points could be streamlined. But in terms of content, he hasn’t really missed anything important.

* **Clarity & Ease of Understanding:** **7/10** – The overall structure of the intro is logical (starting with who he is and what he does, then expanding into details and examples). For the most part, it’s easy to follow. The main hindrance to clarity is pronunciation: as noted, dropping **ending sounds** and mispronouncing certain words can make some phrases harder to catch. For example, an interviewer might take a second to understand “five year” (instead of *five-year*) or “besin” instead of *Bespin*. Also, some phrasing could be smoother (“play with back-end tools” is a bit informal/confusing). Despite these issues, his message does come across, and his grammar is generally correct. With improved pronunciation and a few wording tweaks, his introduction would be very clear and listener-friendly.

# 2\. Summary of Peer Feedback on the Draft Introduction

The written draft and peer comments (draft.txt) provided several insights into strengths and areas to improve. Key feedback points include:

* **Highlight Key Strengths:** The introduction was **technically complete** but felt like a checklist of tasks. Peers suggested focusing on what the speaker is *really good at* – for example, emphasize depth in frameworks or specific accomplishments – rather than just listing duties. One reviewer noted that it wasn’t clear **“what you are strong at and how strong”** in the original version. They advised picking a few main strength areas (e.g. front-end frameworks, leadership, client communication) and expanding on those with evidence (such as tough projects handled, solutions developed, or praise from clients).

* **Provide Examples/Evidence:** Rather than simply stating skills or responsibilities, the feedback encourages giving **brief examples or context** to illustrate those points. For instance, instead of just saying “I have a lot of experience with React/Vue,” mention a challenging project where those skills were put to the test (which the new version does by describing the custom Web Terminal in the Bespin project). Similarly, if claiming leadership experience, one might mention successfully guiding a junior team member or receiving positive results from code reviews.

* **Structure and Flow:** Reviewers liked the content overall but suggested a more **structured narrative**. A common recommendation was to group the intro into clear sections or themes (such as “technical expertise”, “leadership & teamwork”, “major project example”) so that it doesn’t feel like an unrelated list. Using transitional phrases can make the speech flow more naturally. The draft did use “Besides” at one point, but adding more connectors like *“moreover,” “on top of that,” “for example,”* and *“last but not least”* would improve coherence and keep the listener engaged. This helps the introduction sound less robotic and more like a connected story.

* **Tone and Word Choice:** The peers noted a few wording issues. Phrases that were too informal or potentially negative were flagged. For example, saying *“sometimes I also play with back-end tools”* was considered too casual – a more professional phrasing would be *“I have some experience with back-end tools, including…”*. Describing client ideas as *“too crazy”* could be softened to *“too unrealistic”* or *“impractical”* to sound more professional and tactful. Overall, the advice was to maintain a **polite, confident tone**, especially when discussing challenges (e.g. *“I say ‘no’ politely and explain why, offering alternatives”* when dealing with impractical requests).

* **Pronunciation and Delivery Details:** A lot of specific pronunciation corrections were given. The speaker tends to drop **final consonant sounds** (for instance, missing the “s” at the end of words like **“years,” “projects,” “sometimes,” “tools,”** etc.). This is a common issue that can make words sound incomplete. Peers also pointed out mispronunciations: e.g. **“fi**(v)**e”**, **“experien**(ce)**,” “assistant” (the** “s” **sounds),** “besides” **(needs the ending** “s”**),** “analyze” **(pronounce the** “z” **at the end), and words like** “create,” “management,” “leadership,”\*\* which should be pronounced with the proper English sounds (the speaker’s Vietnamese accent caused slight distortions in these). The feedback consistently highlights finishing each word clearly and pronouncing each syllable, which would greatly improve overall clarity. Additionally, small pauses or hesitations on certain words (e.g. stumbling on “leadership”) should be ironed out with practice so the delivery is smooth.

* **Positive Aspects:** The peers did note that the content was **comprehensive and well-organized in parts**. Starting with an introduction of his name and role, then moving through skills, work style, and a project example is a sound approach. The inclusion of the **Bespin project story** was seen as a strong point – it made the introduction more unique and showed off a concrete achievement (impressing investors). They also appreciated that he mentioned soft skills like teamwork philosophy (balancing discipline and flexibility). These elements make the introduction stand out from a generic résumé summary. The suggestions were mostly about *refining* the delivery: making the strong points more vivid, and correcting language issues, rather than removing any major section.

In summary, the feedback calls for a clearer showcase of **personal strengths and impacts**, smoother connections between points, and polishing of language (both word choice and pronunciation). The content itself is strong; it just needs to be presented in a more polished and engaging way.

## Issues

Here’s a consolidated bullet list of the **pronunciation** and **delivery** issues that show up in your YouTube intro, combining my own observations with your friends’ comments:

### Pronunciation – recurring patterns

* **Dropped final consonants (plural “-s”, “-t/-d”, “-v”, “-z”)**:
  *five* missing **/v/** (0:12, 1:23); *sometimes* missing **/s/** (0:26); *tools* missing **/s/** (0:29); *besides* missing **/z/** (0:59); *assistant* missing the third **/s/** (0:57); *analyze* missing **/z/** (1:05); *polite* missing **/t/** (1:14); *it’s* missing **/s/** (2:39); *there is* → “there **is** no” (missing “is”) (2:30); *best* missing **/s/** and **/t/** (3:42). &#x20;
* **English letter-name pronunciation**: *PHP* read in Vietnamese instead of **“P – H – P”** (0:32).&#x20;
* **Word stress / vowel quality**: *create* (“cri-ây t” vs “cri-eɪt”) (0:44); *management* needs clearer syllable stress (0:54); *suggest* flagged to re-check (3:21); *multiple* flagged (3:51).&#x20;
* **Consonant sounds inside words**: *advisor* missing **/z/** (1:35); *organize* missing **/z/** (1:48); *encourage* missing **/g/** (1:53).&#x20;
* **Affricate/fricative endings**: *solution* → ensure **“-tion”** = **/ʃən/** (3:37); *scratch* missing initial **/sk/** (3:39).&#x20;

### Delivery – pacing, flow, and clarity

* **Choppy rhythm from over-punctuation** in the script (too many commas force micro-pauses mid-idea). Example lines:
  “more than, 5 years of experience, in building, modern web applications” and “I love building clean UI, … that, users actually enjoy.”&#x20;
* **Missing linkers/transitions** between ideas makes the talk feel list-like; friends suggest adding connectors such as *in other words, moreover, last but not least, on top of that* to smooth the flow.&#x20;
* **Tone/word choice that hurts professionalism (affects delivery perception)**:
  Replace *“ideas are too crazy”* → **“ideas are impractical”**; say *“I explain why and offer alternatives”*.&#x20;
* **Over-casual phrasing** that distracts:
  *“play with back-end tools”* → **“I have experience with back-end tools, including …”**.&#x20;
* **Unnatural/unclear phrases** that jar the listener:
  *“open to speech”* → **“open communication / open to feedback”**.&#x20;

* Repeated stack mentions.
* Over-detailed feature lists without impact.

# 4\. Revised Self-Introduction (Proposed Version)

*“Hello, my name is* *Do Duc Duy, you can call me Duy. I’m a* *Front-End Developer* *with just over* *5 years of experience* *in building modern web applications. I specialize in* *ReactJS, VueJS, and TypeScript, and I work a lot with* *RESTful APIs* *and* *Tailwind CSS*\* for responsive design[\[2\]](file://file-2GNUbiVFYbiM928LtNPaz9#:~:text=,MySQL%2C%20and%20MongoDB%20when%20needed). I’m also comfortable with back-end tools like Node.js and Laravel when needed, which helps me collaborate effectively with full-stack teams.

In my career, I’ve developed projects across domains like e-commerce, cloud management, CRM, and even AI-powered platforms. I **love crafting clean, user-friendly interfaces** and writing maintainable code that scales. For example, at my last job I wasn’t just coding in isolation – I often **worked directly with international clients** to clarify requirements, propose technical solutions, and estimate timelines. If a client’s idea was technically impractical, I made sure to **politely explain the limitations and suggest better alternatives**. I think that kind of open communication builds trust and leads to better products.

I’ve also had the chance to **lead small front-end teams** (3 to 5 developers) in delivering projects. I enjoy mentoring junior developers – in fact, I used to run regular code review sessions and pair programming, to raise code quality and share knowledge. I believe in a “smart teamwork” approach: keeping code disciplined and clean, but also staying flexible and encouraging new ideas. On top of my development work, I’ve contributed in **technical leadership roles**: I’ve conducted technical interviews to hire developers, and even joined presales discussions as a **front-end advisor**. In those presale phases, I helped transform client ideas into technical plans and proof-of-concepts, **one of which helped our project secure important funding**[\[5\]](file://file-8zNNjSDmUJ8Yn3MdqiUoKH#:~:text=%2A%20Built%20AI,Samsung%2C%20Panasonic%29%20and%20delivered).

Let me give a concrete example. **One of my recent projects is called *Bespin*** – it’s an AI assistant platform for cloud DevOps. In that project, I acted as the front-end tech lead. I started from the presale stage: I analyzed the client’s idea and helped design the high-level architecture. Then I led the development of a challenging feature – a **real-time Web Terminal** in the browser (built with Vue 3\) that lets users control AWS EC2 servers via WebSockets. I even integrated an **AI Copilot** into this terminal, so it can suggest or auto-complete commands. It was a tough but exciting task because there were **no off-the-shelf libraries** for what we needed. We essentially built the terminal client from scratch – handling live stream data, detecting when commands finish, and keeping multiple user sessions in sync. In the end, we succeeded. **Our demo of Bespin wowed the stakeholders**, and I’m proud to say it helped the client **secure multiple rounds of investment** for the project[\[6\]](file://file-8zNNjSDmUJ8Yn3MdqiUoKH#:~:text=,end%20features)[\[7\]](file://file-8zNNjSDmUJ8Yn3MdqiUoKH#:~:text=Achievements%20and%20skills%20gained%3A). That felt like a real validation of the work our team did.

Overall, I would describe myself as a **proactive and confident developer**. I’m always eager to take on new technical challenges, and I take pride in bridging the gap between ideas and execution. I value clear communication – whether it’s within my team or with clients – and I always aim to deliver results that make a measurable impact.

Thank you for listening to my introduction.”\*

*(This revised introduction is crafted to be clear and structured, highlighting Duy’s key technical skills in React/Vue/TypeScript, his experience leading teams and advising clients, and a vivid example of a successful project with a tangible outcome. It’s written in a natural, spoken-English style appropriate for an IELTS 6.0–6.5 level speaker, and should be deliverable in around 3–4 minutes.)*

# 5\. Recommendations for Future Improvement

Finally, here are some recommendations to further improve the delivery and structure of the self-introduction in future versions:

* **Use a Clear Structure:** Organize the introduction around 2–3 main **themes**. For example, one effective structure is: **(a)** Background & Key Skills, **(b)** Leadership/Teamwork & Client Engagement, **(c)** *Star* Project Example & Achievements. This way, the introduction has distinct sections that flow logically, rather than a long list. In the revised version above, we grouped content in this manner to make it easier to follow. In future, whenever updating the intro, ensure new information fits into one of these clear buckets.

* **Add Transitions Between Ideas:** To make the speech flow, use **transitional phrases** to link sections. Instead of jumping abruptly from one point to the next, add connectors like *“Besides that,…”, “For example,…”, “Moreover,…”, “On top of that,…”,* or *“Finally,…”* where appropriate. These phrases guide the listener through your narrative. For instance, after talking about technical skills, you might say *“Besides technical work, I also have experience leading teams…”* to segue into leadership. Transition words act as signposts and will make your speaking style sound more polished and natural.

* **Emphasize Strengths with Examples:** Rather than simply stating what you’ve done, always try to **highlight the impact** or achievement. If you mention a skill or responsibility, ask yourself “What was a success I had here?” and include a short mention of that. In practice sessions, you could prepare a couple of quick metrics or outcomes for each strength (e.g., *“led a team of 5 to deliver a project 2 weeks early,” “improved page load time by 30%,”* or *“secured X dollars in funding”* as in the Bespin example). Including such achievements makes your introduction far more convincing and memorable.

* **Mind Your Tone and Word Choice:** Continue refining the language for professionalism and confidence. Avoid casual slang or potentially negative terms. For example, instead of saying *“crazy ideas,”* **frame it positively or neutrally**: *“very ambitious ideas”* or *“unrealistic requests.”* This maintains a respectful tone. Also, use confident language: say *“I led”* or *“I collaborated”* rather than using too many tentative words like *“I tried”* or *“I helped with.”* Since you’re aiming for a senior developer role, assertive wording (while staying honest) will project confidence. That said, don’t overload on buzzwords – clarity is more important than fancy vocabulary, especially at IELTS 6.0–6.5 level. The goal is to sound **natural yet professional**.

* **Improve Pronunciation and Pace:** Delivery-wise, the **pronunciation of certain sounds** should be a focus area. Pay special attention to **ending consonants** (make a deliberate effort to pronounce the *“-s,” “-t,” “-d,” “-v”* sounds at the end of words)[\[1\]](https://www.wellsaidcoaching.com/blog/pronunciation-and-accent-clarity-for-vietnamese-speakers-of-english#:~:text=English%20www,Unvoiced%20Consonants%3A). It might feel exaggerated, but it will actually come out clearly to the listener. You can practice by reading sentences from your intro slowly and overemphasizing the final letters, then gradually increase speed. Also practice any words you found tricky in the video: *“experience”* (make sure it doesn’t sound like “experien”), *“five”* (with a clear v sound), *“management”* (pronounce the **“-ment”**), *“leadership”* (don’t pause in the middle), and so on. Recording yourself and listening back can help catch these issues. In addition, maintain a **steady, moderate pace**. It’s common when nervous to speak too fast or swallow word endings. Consciously slow down just a little, and use natural pauses (for breath or between topic shifts). This will give you time to enunciate clearly and also make it easier for the interviewer to follow. Remember, clarity is more important than speed.

* **Engage with Confident Body Language (for live delivery):** While this is more about delivery than script content, it’s worth noting. In an actual interview or video, your body language and voice modulation matter. Practice delivering this intro while looking in a mirror or recording video – smile where appropriate, use hand gestures naturally, and maintain good posture. A confident stance and a smile can make you appear more engaging. **Voice modulation** is also key: stress important words (like your key skills or achievements) and vary your tone to avoid sounding monotonous. For example, when you reach the success part of your project story (“*our demo impressed investors*”), let your tone show enthusiasm. These non-verbal cues will make your introduction more compelling and help keep the interviewer’s attention.

* **Keep it Concise:** The revised script is comprehensive, but always be mindful of time. In an interview introduction, you typically have a couple of minutes. The current version should fit in about 3-4 minutes when spoken at a comfortable pace. That’s probably the upper limit. It’s a good idea to **time yourself** when practicing, and trim any unnecessary details if you find it’s running too long. For instance, if needed, you could condense the project description to the most critical points (role, tech, outcome) to save time. Future versions should remain focused: include the highlights that make you a strong candidate, and leave deeper details for the interviewer to ask in follow-up questions.

By implementing these recommendations, each subsequent version of the self-introduction can get smoother and more impactful. The combination of a clear structure, confident content, polished language, and practiced delivery will ensure that you make a **strong first impression** in an English-language job interview. Good luck with your upcoming interviews\!
